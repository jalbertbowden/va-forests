<dd>

VAFOREST is a map of forestland in Virginia that meets the United States Forest Service, Forest Inventory and Analysis Program's definition of forestland. Forestland is defined as lands with at least a stocking of 10% cover of live forest trees of any size, or formerly having such tree cover, and not currently developed for non-forest use. The minimum area for classification of forestland is usually 1 acre with a minimum width of 120 feet stem-to-stem. Forested strips must be at least 120 feet wide for a continuous length of at least 363 feet in order to meet the acre threshold. Unimproved roads and trails, and clearings in forest areas are classified as forest if less than 120 feet wide or smaller than 1 acre.
<P>
The map was developed through the classification of Landsat 7 ETM+ satellite imagery, acquired in the years 1999 and 2000, and refined using various ancillary data sets and algorithms.  Classification training and accuracy assessment was done using over 7,000 Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) ground data plots.

<A NAME="why"><h3>Why was the data set created?</h3></A>
<blockquote>
VAFOREST was developed primarily to provide stratification for the estimation of forestland area.  It is also being used to examine forest fragmentation and landscape patch analysis, at appropriate scales.  Additional uses include image masking for forest type classification, and as a baseline for forest health, disturbance and harvest monitoring.
