,,,,,"Glued laminated timber (glulam). Engineered, stress-rated"
,,,,,product created by adhesively bonding individual pieces of
,,,,,lumber with thickness of 2 in. or less. Glulam is versatile and
,,,,,can be shaped into forms ranging from straight to complex
,,,,,"curved beams. Uses include headers, girders, purlins, beams,"
,,,,,and arches.
,,,,,Laminated veneer lumber (LVL). Structural composite
,,,,,lumber product made by adhesively bonding thin sheets of
,,,,,wood veneer into a large billet. The grain of the veneers is
,,,,,oriented parallel in the “long” direction. The billet is then
,,,,,"sawn to desired dimensions. Uses include headers, beams,"
,,,,,"rafters, scaffold planking, and flanges for prefabricated"
,,,,,wood I-joists.
,,,,,"Lumber. Solid sawn timber, including dimension, boards"
,,,,,and squares.
,,,,,Nonstructural panels. Wood-based panels not specifically
,,,,,"designed for structural applications. Includes particleboard,"
,,,,,"medium density fiberboard, hardboard, insulation board, and"
,,,,,"hardwood plywood. Uses include siding, floor underlay-"
,,,,,"ment, interior wall paneling, and numerous industrial appli-"
,,,,,cations.
,,,,,Oriented strandboard (OSB). Performance rated wood
,,,,,panels consisting of layered and oriented wood strands
,,,,,adhesively bonded. Both softwood and hardwood species are
,,,,,used. OSB may include small amounts of waferboard (wood
