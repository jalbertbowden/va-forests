,2. Concrete and masonry buildings with lumber framed and
,sheathed gable roof systems—Because many of these
,"buildings were originally made with slate roof shingles,"
,the roof systems were designed to carry the extra weight
,of these shingles and were thus lumber intensive. The re-
,maining concrete and masonry buildings with lumber
,framed and sheathed roofs had asphalt shingles or copper
,roofing. These buildings are primarily Housing and
,"Administrative (Fig. 8, Facility A51)."
,3. Concrete and steel-framed hangars with lumber roof
,sheathing and lumber nailing strips attached to a steel-
,framed roof—End walls and office areas inside the han-
,gars are commonly lumber framed and sheathed. These
,buildings are primarily in the Maintenance facility cate-
,"gory (Fig. 8, Facility LP4)."
,4. Warehouses with lumber framed and sheathed walls and
,roofs—Many large warehouses built in the 1940s had
,massive wood roof trusses supporting a roof system of
,lumber rafters and lumber sheathing. Roofs were generally
,barrel-shaped and were supported by large wood columns
,and posts. Lumber framed interior office areas were typi-
,cally added and removed as needed. Many warehouses of
,"this type were recently demolished (Fig. 8, Facility SP89)."
,Wood Products in All Buildings
,"In 2000, the 603 wood buildings at NAVSTA Norfolk con-"
,"tained an estimated 6,031 thousand BF of framing lumber,"
,"5,604 thousand BF of sheathing lumber, 350 thousand ft2 of"
,"softwood plywood, 12 thousand ft2 of OSB, and 83 thou-"
,sand ft2 of fiberboard. All the softwood plywood and OSB
,were used for floor decking and wall and roof sheathing. The
,fiberboard was used primarily for wall sheathing. Roof
,systems were by far the most intensive structural application
,"utilizing wood, using more than 70% of each wood product"
,except fiberboard. This was due in part to a fairly large
,number of concrete and masonry buildings with lumber
,framed and sheathed gable roof systems (construction type
,"2), warehouses with lumber framed and sheathed roofs"
,"(construction type 4), hangars with steel-framed and lumber-"
,"sheathed roofs (construction type 3), and wood-framed"
,buildings with conventional roof systems (construction

that contain wood: (top to bottom) conventional wood-,undetermined amounts of fiberboard were used as a base for
"framed construction (Facility A67), concrete and ma-","built-up flat roof systems, particularly on buildings where"

trusses (SP89).,"14% (1,627 thousand BF) of all lumber and 11% (41 thou-"
,sand ft2 ) of structural panels were used for floors. More than
,half the lumber for floors was used for framing. Nearly 90%
,of all buildings had either a concrete slab on grade or a
,raised concrete slab ground level floor system. This very
,high incidence of concrete slab floor systems resulted in
