Forest Harvesting in Virginia,
Characteristics of Virginia’s Logging Operations,
Introduction,
"Virginia’s forests are a vital resource, providing multiple benefits for the",
"commonwealth’s citizens, forest landowners, and the forest industry. More than",
"15 million acres, nearly two thirds of the state is forested. These forests provide",
"an estimated $23 billion in total economic output, annually, and provide forestry",
"related jobs to nearly 145,000 (Rephann 2008). Forest harvesting is often a critical",
component of forest management1. Logging operations are essential to implementing,
"forest management plans and providing income to forest landowners. In 2011, more",
"than 5,900 timber harvests occurred on more than 248,000 acres of Virginia’s",
"forested land, and net growth continues to exceed the volume harvested (VDOF 2011).",
Virginia’s forest industry produces a broad array of products to meet the needs of,
"consumers. These diverse products include paper, packaging, corrugated containers,",
"specialty chemicals, structural lumber for home construction, and solid hardwood or",
"veneers used for furniture, flooring, and paneling. Virginia’s forests also provide a",
"source of renewable energy for producing electricity, heating homes and businesses,",
and providing power to manufacturing facilities. The forest industry depends on a,
"supply chain, which includes forest landowners who grow timber, logging businesses",
"that harvest and transport timber, and mills that produce the forest products we use.",
"Each link is critical and, without all the links in the supply chain, Virginia’s multi-billion",
dollar forest industry could not continue to operate.,
There are an estimated 900 logging businesses in Virginia that harvest and transport,1
"timber to wood processing facilities. Logging businesses are primarily small, family",
"owned and operated, and provide the link between Virginia’s forest landowners",
and the manufacturers who produce forest products. Logging businesses operate,
in a challenging and often dangerous environment where they deal with constantly,
"changing weather conditions, fluctuating prices and markets for forest products, and",
"work with equipment and systems, which require substantial amounts of capital to",
operate.,
Most people have a general idea of what they think a logging operation looks like.,
"However, logging systems can vary significantly among loggers and across regions.",
Loggers in one part of the state may not be aware of what loggers in another part,
"of the state are doing. Understanding logging systems, and the equipment utilized,",
can help everyone involved in the wood supply chain make good decisions related to,
forest harvesting.,
Forest Harvesting in Virginia
Characteristics of Virginia’s Logging Operations
This publication is based on a 2009 survey of Virginia loggers2 and provides a
snapshot of logging operations across the state. The goal is to provide insight into
"the basic functions of a forest harvesting operation in Virginia, and to provide specific"
operational details related to the characteristics and production levels of Virginia’s
logging businesses. It provides introductory information for those not familiar with
"forest harvesting operations, as well as specific results of the logger survey and more"
detailed comparisons of logging across the Commonwealth.

,Felling
,Felling is the process of severing the tree
,stem from the stump so it can be moved
,and further processed. Manual and
,mechanized felling are the two general
,methods for felling trees. Manual felling
,"involves an operator on the ground, using"
,a chainsaw (Figure 2) to cut the tree.
,Mechanized felling utilizes a machine to
,cut the tree. There are several types of
"Figure 2. Manual felling, using a chainsaw.",machines used for mechanized felling. The
,most common in Virginia are rubber-tired
,"feller-bunchers (Figure 3), which are driven"
,"to each tree, and generally use a rotating"
,disc saw head to cut the tree. These
,machines can accumulate several small
,trees before laying them down in a bunch
,to help facilitate skidding. Some operations
,also utilize tracked feller-bunchers that are
,mounted on a tracked machine similar to
,"an excavator, and have a feller-buncher"
,head mounted on a boom. The boom
,allows the feller-buncher to reach out and
4,harvest multiple trees without moving
,the machine. Although not common in
,"Virginia, a cut-to-length harvester is another"
,type of mechanized harvesting machine
,"which not only cuts the tree down, but also"
,"removes the limbs, and cuts the stem to"
,merchantable lengths.
,Skidding
,Skidding is the process of moving felled
,trees from the stump to a centralized
,"location, often called a landing, where"
,they can be further processed and loaded
Figure 3. Mechanized felling with a rubber,onto trucks. Skidders generally use either
tire feller buncher.,a mechanical grapple or a system with
,Forest Harvesting in Virginia
Characteristics of Virginia’s Logging Operations,
"cables to grasp the stems, and lift one end",
of the logs off the ground as they transport,
them back to the landing. Cable skidders,
(Figure 4) require the operator to pull the,
"cable out to each felled tree, and manually",
hook a choker to each log. A choker is,
a short cable or chain similar to a noose,
"that goes around each log, and is attached",
to the cable. Cable skidders enable the,
operator to winch logs back to the skidder,
without having to drive to the log. This,Figure 4. Cable skidder
is particularly helpful on steep terrain.,
Grapple skidders (Figure 5) are driven,
"to each stem or bunch of stems, and use a hydraulically powered grapple (similar to",
"large tongs), which can be operated from the cab to grab and lift one end of the stems",
before moving them. Two other less common methods include using a bulldozer with,
"an attached cable and winch system, or using a forwarder. Bulldozers are generally",
used in very steep terrain. A forwarder is typically used in combination with a cut-to-,
"length harvester, and transports cut-to-length logs in a bunk (similar to a log truck)",
rather than skidding them on the ground.,

,Delimbing is the process of,
,removing limbs from the tree,
,"stem, and utilizes either a",
,chainsaw or one of several,
,mechanized delimbing,
,methods. On mechanized,
,"felling operations, delimbing",
,is typically performed at the,
,landing. On manual felling,
,"operations, delimbing is often",
,performed with a chainsaw,Figure 7. Knuckle Boom Loader
Forest Harvesting in Virginia
Characteristics of Virginia’s Logging Operations
prior to skidding. A common mechanized delimbing method utilizes a pull through
delimber (Figure 8) where the loader pulls the stem through a set of knives to break
"off branches. Other less common methods of delimbing include chain flail delimbers,"
"delimbing gates, and stroke delimbers. A chain flail delimber uses rotating chains to"
break off limbs. Delimbing gates are used by some operations harvesting southern
"pines, and involve attaching a delimbing gate to two trees or tall stumps. The skidder"
"operator backs the trees into the delimbing gate, which breaks the limbs off as"
the trees are pushed through. A stroke delimber is a machine that pulls the tree
"stem through a set of knives, which break the branches off as the tree stem passes"
through.
While manual delimbing typically leaves the limbs distributed across the harvest
"site, mechanized delimbing operations typically leave the limbs concentrated at the"
"landing. The limbs are then piled on the landing, carried back into the harvest site, or"
utilized for fuel.
Bucking is the process of cutting the tree into shorter lengths to meet the
"specifications for length, diameter, or other quality criteria required by the market(s)"
where the tree will be sold. Bucking is generally accomplished with chainsaws or

,a hydraulically powered
,buck saw (Figure 9) (also
,"called a slasher saw), which"
,resembles a large chainsaw
,bar. While not common in
,"Virginia, bucking can also"
,be accomplished with a
,"swing boom processor, a"
,machine that has an attached
,processing head designed to
,accurately measure and buck
,logs to specified lengths. In
,"some cases, no bucking is"
,"required with smaller trees,"
,and the entire tree is loaded
,onto the truck after delimbing.
,Chipping (Figure 10) and
,grinding are other forms of
,"processing, which can occur"
"Figure 9. Buck saw, also referred to as slasher saw.",at the landing on some
,operations.

Forest Harvesting in Virginia,
Characteristics of Virginia’s Logging Operations,
Loading,
"Loading, or the process of putting logs onto trucks, generally occurs at the landing",
and is normally handled by a knuckleboom loader. The loader is a key piece of,
"equipment on the landing, and is typically involved in all the other processing",
"steps. Knuckleboom loaders are often mounted on a stationary trailer, but can also",
be mobile if they are mounted on a tracked carrier or a truck. Other less common,
"methods of loading include farm tractors, front-end loaders, or self-loading log trucks",
that have a knuckle boom loader attached to the truck. In the case of chipping,
"operations, the chipper normally discharges directly into a trailer, often referred to as",
"a chip van, so it chips and loads at the same time.",
Trucking,
"Once the logs are processed, they are transported to a mill. Specific truck and trailer",
combinations for transporting logs to market can vary by region. The configuration can,
"vary based on operating conditions, including type of access roads, the type of timber",
"harvested, and the travel distances to mills. The most common log truck configuration",
is a tractor and trailer combination with a log trailer frame and attached bolsters,
(uprights) to hold logs in place (Figure 11). Other trucking configurations can include,
"small single axle trucks, tandem or tri-axle trucks or tandem or tri-axle trucks with a",
pup trailer. The pup trailer holds an additional stack of logs and is towed behind the,
truck.,
"While average payloads will vary by trucking configurations, the rule of thumb for a",
tractor-trailer log trucking combination is about 25 tons of wood per load.,
Logging business owners were asked to report the single most common method they,9
normally use to perform each of these harvesting functions at their operations. The,
methods reported by logging businesses (Table 1) show considerable differences by,
region.,

,Forest Harvesting in Virginia
,Characteristics of Virginia’s Logging Operations
,Piedmont
"In terms of terrain and forest harvesting operations, the Piedmont is a transitional",
area between the steeper mountains to the west and the flatter Coastal Plain to the,
"east. The Piedmont has some characteristics of operations to the east and west, but in",
"general, the logging operations are more like those in the Coastal Plain. The majority",
of Piedmont operations utilize mechanized harvesting with rubber tired feller bunchers,
"and grapple skidders, and often skid whole trees to the landing where delimbing and",
bucking are performed. These operations also tend to be more productive. Production,
"rates are more than twice what they are for mountain logging operations; on average,",
"they produce 22.4 loads per crew, per week. While hardwood harvests still represent",
"slightly more than half the harvest types reported by piedmont loggers, hardwood",
"clearcuts are more common than select cuts, and the amount of pine harvested",
increased substantially when compared to the mountains. Pine thinning and clearcuts,
represent more than a third of the total harvests reported by Piedmont loggers. The,
"Piedmont also has several markets for dirty chips or biomass to produce energy and,",
"as a result, it is much more common to find chippers on Piedmont logging operations.",
"Throughout the entire Piedmont region, 16 percent of loggers indicated they had a",
"chipper, and produced dirty (fuel) chips from logging residues. In some areas of the",
"southern Piedmont, it is even more common to find loggers with chippers at their",
"operations. Across all logging operations in the Piedmont, dirty (fuel) chips represent",
nearly 4 percent of all production reported by logging businesses.,
,Coastal Plain
,15
"In general, the Coastal Plain has the most mechanized and highest production logging",
operations in the state. These businesses have an average production rate of 32.2,
"loads per crew, per week. They are also more likely to have multiple logging crews",
"per business owner, with an average of 1.43 crews per business. Coastal Plain",
operations also tend to have the highest number of workers per crew with an average,
of 4.2 workers per crew working in the woods. Coastal Plain logging is predominantly,
"oriented toward pine harvesting with pine pulpwood and sawtimber, representing",
nearly 57 percent of the total products produced. The single most common type,
of harvest reported was a pine thinning operation. Chipping operations are more,
common in the Coastal Plain than in other regions. Although they make up a relatively,
"small percentage of all operations, whole tree chippers with a chain flail produce",
"clean chips, which represent about four percent of the total production reported. The",
most common type of harvesting equipment utilized in the Coastal Plain is a rubber-,
"tired feller-buncher with grapple skidders and a trailer-mounted knuckle boom loader,",
utilizing a pull through delimber.,

Forest Harvesting in Virginia
Characteristics of Virginia’s Logging Operations

Most people have a general idea of what they think a logging
"operation looks like. However, logging systems can vary significantly"
among loggers and across regions. Loggers in one part of the state
may not be aware of what loggers in another part of the state are
"doing. Understanding logging systems, and the equipment utilized,"
can help everyone involved in the wood supply chain make good
decisions related to forest harvesting.
