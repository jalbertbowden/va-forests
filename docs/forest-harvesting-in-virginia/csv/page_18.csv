,2,The data on characteristics of Virginia logging businesses comes from a mail survey
,,of participants in the Virginia SHARP logger program. The SHARP Logger program
,,"includes most Virginia logging businesses. This mail survey, based on 488 business"
,,"owner responses, had an overall 59 percent rate. Data is based on information"
,,"provided by individual businesses and represents small, part time logging operations"
,,as well as high production logging businesses. The averages of responses received
,,"provide a good representation of the logging workforce, but are not necessarily"
,,actual harvest and production data.
