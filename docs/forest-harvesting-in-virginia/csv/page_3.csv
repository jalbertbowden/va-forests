Forest Harvesting in Virginia,
Characteristics of Virginia’s Logging Operations,
Introduction,
"Virginia’s forests are a vital resource, providing multiple benefits for the",
"commonwealth’s citizens, forest landowners, and the forest industry. More than",
"15 million acres, nearly two thirds of the state is forested. These forests provide",
"an estimated $23 billion in total economic output, annually, and provide forestry",
"related jobs to nearly 145,000 (Rephann 2008). Forest harvesting is often a critical",
component of forest management1. Logging operations are essential to implementing,
"forest management plans and providing income to forest landowners. In 2011, more",
"than 5,900 timber harvests occurred on more than 248,000 acres of Virginia’s",
"forested land, and net growth continues to exceed the volume harvested (VDOF 2011).",
Virginia’s forest industry produces a broad array of products to meet the needs of,
"consumers. These diverse products include paper, packaging, corrugated containers,",
"specialty chemicals, structural lumber for home construction, and solid hardwood or",
"veneers used for furniture, flooring, and paneling. Virginia’s forests also provide a",
"source of renewable energy for producing electricity, heating homes and businesses,",
and providing power to manufacturing facilities. The forest industry depends on a,
"supply chain, which includes forest landowners who grow timber, logging businesses",
"that harvest and transport timber, and mills that produce the forest products we use.",
"Each link is critical and, without all the links in the supply chain, Virginia’s multi-billion",
dollar forest industry could not continue to operate.,
There are an estimated 900 logging businesses in Virginia that harvest and transport,1
"timber to wood processing facilities. Logging businesses are primarily small, family",
"owned and operated, and provide the link between Virginia’s forest landowners",
and the manufacturers who produce forest products. Logging businesses operate,
in a challenging and often dangerous environment where they deal with constantly,
"changing weather conditions, fluctuating prices and markets for forest products, and",
"work with equipment and systems, which require substantial amounts of capital to",
operate.,
Most people have a general idea of what they think a logging operation looks like.,
"However, logging systems can vary significantly among loggers and across regions.",
Loggers in one part of the state may not be aware of what loggers in another part,
"of the state are doing. Understanding logging systems, and the equipment utilized,",
can help everyone involved in the wood supply chain make good decisions related to,
forest harvesting.,
