,Felling
,Felling is the process of severing the tree
,stem from the stump so it can be moved
,and further processed. Manual and
,mechanized felling are the two general
,methods for felling trees. Manual felling
,"involves an operator on the ground, using"
,a chainsaw (Figure 2) to cut the tree.
,Mechanized felling utilizes a machine to
,cut the tree. There are several types of
"Figure 2. Manual felling, using a chainsaw.",machines used for mechanized felling. The
,most common in Virginia are rubber-tired
,"feller-bunchers (Figure 3), which are driven"
,"to each tree, and generally use a rotating"
,disc saw head to cut the tree. These
,machines can accumulate several small
,trees before laying them down in a bunch
,to help facilitate skidding. Some operations
,also utilize tracked feller-bunchers that are
,mounted on a tracked machine similar to
,"an excavator, and have a feller-buncher"
,head mounted on a boom. The boom
,allows the feller-buncher to reach out and

,the machine. Although not common in
,"Virginia, a cut-to-length harvester is another"
,type of mechanized harvesting machine
,"which not only cuts the tree down, but also"
,"removes the limbs, and cuts the stem to"
,merchantable lengths.
,Skidding
,Skidding is the process of moving felled
,trees from the stump to a centralized
,"location, often called a landing, where"
,they can be further processed and loaded
