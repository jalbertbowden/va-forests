Forest Harvesting in Virginia,
Characteristics of Virginia’s Logging Operations,
Loading,
"Loading, or the process of putting logs onto trucks, generally occurs at the landing",
and is normally handled by a knuckleboom loader. The loader is a key piece of,
"equipment on the landing, and is typically involved in all the other processing",
"steps. Knuckleboom loaders are often mounted on a stationary trailer, but can also",
be mobile if they are mounted on a tracked carrier or a truck. Other less common,
"methods of loading include farm tractors, front-end loaders, or self-loading log trucks",
that have a knuckle boom loader attached to the truck. In the case of chipping,
"operations, the chipper normally discharges directly into a trailer, often referred to as",
"a chip van, so it chips and loads at the same time.",
Trucking,
"Once the logs are processed, they are transported to a mill. Specific truck and trailer",
combinations for transporting logs to market can vary by region. The configuration can,
"vary based on operating conditions, including type of access roads, the type of timber",
"harvested, and the travel distances to mills. The most common log truck configuration",
is a tractor and trailer combination with a log trailer frame and attached bolsters,
(uprights) to hold logs in place (Figure 11). Other trucking configurations can include,
"small single axle trucks, tandem or tri-axle trucks or tandem or tri-axle trucks with a",
pup trailer. The pup trailer holds an additional stack of logs and is towed behind the,
truck.,
"While average payloads will vary by trucking configurations, the rule of thumb for a",
tractor-trailer log trucking combination is about 25 tons of wood per load.,
Logging business owners were asked to report the single most common method they,9
normally use to perform each of these harvesting functions at their operations. The,
methods reported by logging businesses (Table 1) show considerable differences by,
region.,
