,Forest Harvesting in Virginia
Characteristics of Virginia’s Logging Operations,
"cables to grasp the stems, and lift one end",
of the logs off the ground as they transport,
them back to the landing. Cable skidders,
(Figure 4) require the operator to pull the,
"cable out to each felled tree, and manually",
hook a choker to each log. A choker is,
a short cable or chain similar to a noose,
"that goes around each log, and is attached",
to the cable. Cable skidders enable the,
operator to winch logs back to the skidder,
without having to drive to the log. This,Figure 4. Cable skidder
is particularly helpful on steep terrain.,
Grapple skidders (Figure 5) are driven,
"to each stem or bunch of stems, and use a hydraulically powered grapple (similar to",
"large tongs), which can be operated from the cab to grab and lift one end of the stems",
before moving them. Two other less common methods include using a bulldozer with,
"an attached cable and winch system, or using a forwarder. Bulldozers are generally",
used in very steep terrain. A forwarder is typically used in combination with a cut-to-,
"length harvester, and transports cut-to-length logs in a bunk (similar to a log truck)",
rather than skidding them on the ground.,
