Forest Harvesting in Virginia
Characteristics of Virginia’s Logging Operations
prior to skidding. A common mechanized delimbing method utilizes a pull through
delimber (Figure 8) where the loader pulls the stem through a set of knives to break
"off branches. Other less common methods of delimbing include chain flail delimbers,"
"delimbing gates, and stroke delimbers. A chain flail delimber uses rotating chains to"
break off limbs. Delimbing gates are used by some operations harvesting southern
"pines, and involve attaching a delimbing gate to two trees or tall stumps. The skidder"
"operator backs the trees into the delimbing gate, which breaks the limbs off as"
the trees are pushed through. A stroke delimber is a machine that pulls the tree
"stem through a set of knives, which break the branches off as the tree stem passes"
through.
While manual delimbing typically leaves the limbs distributed across the harvest
"site, mechanized delimbing operations typically leave the limbs concentrated at the"
"landing. The limbs are then piled on the landing, carried back into the harvest site, or"
utilized for fuel.
Bucking is the process of cutting the tree into shorter lengths to meet the
"specifications for length, diameter, or other quality criteria required by the market(s)"
where the tree will be sold. Bucking is generally accomplished with chainsaws or
