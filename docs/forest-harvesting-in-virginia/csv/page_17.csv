,Forest Harvesting in Virginia
,Characteristics of Virginia’s Logging Operations
,Piedmont
"In terms of terrain and forest harvesting operations, the Piedmont is a transitional",
area between the steeper mountains to the west and the flatter Coastal Plain to the,
"east. The Piedmont has some characteristics of operations to the east and west, but in",
"general, the logging operations are more like those in the Coastal Plain. The majority",
of Piedmont operations utilize mechanized harvesting with rubber tired feller bunchers,
"and grapple skidders, and often skid whole trees to the landing where delimbing and",
bucking are performed. These operations also tend to be more productive. Production,
"rates are more than twice what they are for mountain logging operations; on average,",
"they produce 22.4 loads per crew, per week. While hardwood harvests still represent",
"slightly more than half the harvest types reported by piedmont loggers, hardwood",
"clearcuts are more common than select cuts, and the amount of pine harvested",
increased substantially when compared to the mountains. Pine thinning and clearcuts,
represent more than a third of the total harvests reported by Piedmont loggers. The,
"Piedmont also has several markets for dirty chips or biomass to produce energy and,",
"as a result, it is much more common to find chippers on Piedmont logging operations.",
"Throughout the entire Piedmont region, 16 percent of loggers indicated they had a",
"chipper, and produced dirty (fuel) chips from logging residues. In some areas of the",
"southern Piedmont, it is even more common to find loggers with chippers at their",
"operations. Across all logging operations in the Piedmont, dirty (fuel) chips represent",
nearly 4 percent of all production reported by logging businesses.,
,Coastal Plain
,15
"In general, the Coastal Plain has the most mechanized and highest production logging",
operations in the state. These businesses have an average production rate of 32.2,
"loads per crew, per week. They are also more likely to have multiple logging crews",
"per business owner, with an average of 1.43 crews per business. Coastal Plain",
operations also tend to have the highest number of workers per crew with an average,
of 4.2 workers per crew working in the woods. Coastal Plain logging is predominantly,
"oriented toward pine harvesting with pine pulpwood and sawtimber, representing",
nearly 57 percent of the total products produced. The single most common type,
of harvest reported was a pine thinning operation. Chipping operations are more,
common in the Coastal Plain than in other regions. Although they make up a relatively,
"small percentage of all operations, whole tree chippers with a chain flail produce",
"clean chips, which represent about four percent of the total production reported. The",
most common type of harvesting equipment utilized in the Coastal Plain is a rubber-,
"tired feller-buncher with grapple skidders and a trailer-mounted knuckle boom loader,",
utilizing a pull through delimber.,
