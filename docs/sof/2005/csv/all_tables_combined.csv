From the State Forester
Greetings. I am proud to present to you Virginia’s first State of the Forest report. This is the equivalent
of an annual report that will set baseline data to measure the success and accomplishments associated
with the Virginia Department of Forestry’s strategic plan – DOF 2014 Shaping Virginia’s Forests. In
"addition, this account will document the challenges we envision the agency having to address in the"
coming years.
"The 2004-2005 year was one of great change in the agency. My predecessor, James Garner, retired"
in October ’04 after serving the Commonwealth for 46 years – the last 21 as your State Forester. In
"November ’04, Gov. Mark Warner appointed me only the sixth State Forester in the 91-year history"
"of the DOF. Just two months later, the Hon. Robert Bloxom was installed as Virginia’s first-ever"
Secretary of Agriculture and Forestry. Together we set out to raise awareness of the value that our
forest resources provide the Commonwealth. We sought to provide new and better services to the
"citizens of the Commonwealth. We expanded our education, outreach and fire prevention efforts. We"
"stepped up our forest management, forest research and forest health programs. We restructured the"
management staff and its accountability. We redesigned the agency’s shield to better reflect our many
"and diverse roles in ensuring healthy, sustainable forest resources for Virginians. And we increased"
awareness of the agency and its mission in the minds of the public.
"Most importantly, Virginia’s 15.8 million acres of forest land are in relatively good health. While parts"
of the state saw hundreds of oak trees die and other areas are dealing with problems associated with
"the hemlock woolly adelgid, we experienced virtually no southern pine beetle or gypsy moth activity."
"Development pressures continued, however, as 20,000 acres of privately owned forest land were"
converted to other uses. Two new State Forests (Sandy Point in King William County and Browne in
"Essex County) totaling 2,172 acres brought the number of State Forests to 17. We now have a total"
"of 48,112 acres of forest land under the protection and management of our agency. Department"
"staff developed plans for landowners that covered another 147,088 acres. This year, our nurseries"
"harvested and sold more than 33 million seedlings, and DOF staff oversaw the planting of more than"
"25 million of those seedlings. This renewed another 80,331 acres of forest land."
Our Resource Protection efforts aided in a 54 percent reduction in the number of fires (579 versus
"our five-year average of 1,250) and a 64 percent reduction in the number of acres burned (4,028 vs."
"the five-year average of 10,500). To ensure the steady flow of clean water, we inspected nearly 5,000"
logging jobs this year – with 78 penalties (1.6 percent) assessed.
"While many challenges remain, the future is positive for Virginia’s forest resources – an economic"
engine that drives more than $30 Billion in benefits to the Commonwealth each year. I invite you to
take a few moments to review the rest of this report – I’m certain you’ll find it to be well worth your
time.
"Sincerely,"
Carl E. Garrison III
State Forester

Virginia Forest Trends,Virginia Forest Trends
Forested Land Volume,
"With 15.8 million acres of forested land, Virginia is",each year but reversion of some agricultural land to
62% forested. From 1992 to 2001 urban growth and,forest partially offsets the loss). If current development
"development resulted in an average net loss of 20,000","trends continue, it has been projected that Virginia will"
acres per year. (More acres of forest are developed,lose a million acres of forest in the next 25 years.
