From the State Forester
This third edition of the annual State of the Forest Report is a candid assessment of the challenges and
opportunities facing not only the Virginia Department of Forestry but the quality of life in the Commonwealth.
"There are several positive indicators contained herein, but there are some major issues that threaten the"
health and viability of our forests.
The business of forestry (estimated to provide more than $27 Billion in annual benefits to Virginia)
has been aided greatly by the science of forestry as practiced by this Agency. VDOF foresters and
forestry technicians in the field are helping forest landowners meet their objectives by advising them on
the application of effective forestry practices to their individual tracts. Agency researchers are proving that
low-density plantings of genetically improved loblolly pine seedlings can yield well-stocked stands with
"high-quality crop trees, and that hardwood crop-tree release combined with fertilization can nearly double"
tree diameter growth. Both of these are good news for forest landowners.
"Through our newly-enhanced water quality program, we now have additional, well-trained water quality"
specialists working with timber harvesters to ensure Virginia’s water supplies in or adjacent to harvest
sites remain clean. This helps reduce the need for expensive water treatment systems for individuals
and municipal governments. And it can save timber harvesters and forest landowners money by avoiding
costly fines because their actions aren’t fouling area waterways.
"Forests help clean our air, clean our water, moderate the climate, provide habitat for animals and plants,"
"and offer unparalleled beauty. In Virginia, these “eco-systems services” are worth more than $1.7 billion"
"annually, yet they cost most people nothing."
"Each day, more and more forest land is developed for other purposes, and this land-use change is one"
"of the greatest challenges facing Virginia. Unless we reverse the loss of 27,300 acres (up from 26,100"
"last year) of forest land each year, all of the many benefits offered by our forests are at risk and so is the"
quality of our life.
"To learn more about your Virginia Department of Forestry, I invite you to read the rest of this report. Thank"
"you for your support as we protect and develop healthy, sustainable forest resources for Virginians."
"Sincerely,"
Carl E. Garrison III
