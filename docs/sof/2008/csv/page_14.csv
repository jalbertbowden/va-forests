Protecting
Virginia’s Water Quality
Water quality is important to all Virginians. Studies have shown
that the cleanest water comes from forested watersheds. These
"watersheds are critical sources of pure drinking water, habitat for"
"important fisheries, and areas that are treasured for their recreational"
value and purity of life. Two of the Department’s important
measures involve water quality. One focuses on Best Management
Practices on forest harvesting operations and protecting streams
from sediment. The other focuses on improving and protecting
watersheds through management and land conservation.
The Virginia Department of Forestry has been involved with the
protection of our forested watersheds since the early 1970s with the
development of our first set of Forestry Best Management Practices
(BMPs) for Water Quality. The Department is now utilizing the
"fourth edition of those guidelines, and has circulated copies of"
its latest version nationwide as well as to numerous countries
worldwide. The backbone for the Department’s water quality effort
is the harvest inspection program which began in the mid-‘80s.
This program has provided for one-on-one contact between VDOF
and the harvest operators and a welcomed opportunity to educate
the operators on BMPs and the latest in water quality protection
"techniques. In fiscal year 2008, VDOF field personnel inspected"
"5,071 timber harvest sites across Virginia on 241,328 acres."
Another main focus of the VDOF water quality program is logger
education. Since the development of the first BMP Manual for
"Virginia, the VDOF has been involved in the training of harvesting"
contractors in water quality protection techniques ranging from
"harvest planning, map reading and the use of GPS units to BMP"
implementation. This occurred through training that the agency
"sponsored and, more recently, through VDOF participation in the"
SFI® SHARP (Sustainable Harvesting and Resource Professional)
"Logger Training Program. Since 1996, this program has enabled"
"VDOF to assist in training 6,202 harvesting professionals in 185"
different programs relating to water quality protection. For fiscal
"year 2007, there were 15 training programs offered with 402"
attendees present. Five of these courses were in the core area
"with 116 attendees, and the remaining 10 courses were for logger"
continuing education and had 286 attendees.
"In July 1993, the General Assembly of Virginia with"
"the support of the forest industry,"
