From the State Forester
This is my fourth annual report to you since becoming State Forester of Virginia in late 2004. Much has
"changed in Virginia’s forests since my last report one year ago. Some of the changes have been positive, but"
many are not. This report is intended to provide a candid assessment of the challenges and opportunities
"facing the Virginia Department of Forestry (VDOF), the forest lands of Virginia, and, ultimately the quality"
of life in our Commonwealth.
"The latest forest inventory assessment puts the loss of forest land in the Commonwealth at 27,000 acres"
"annually. If this trend continues, Virginia could lose 1 million of its 15.7 million acres of forest land within"
"25 years. In addition to the threats posed by development, the forests are under siege by a host of invasive"
"insects and plants. Gypsy moths defoliated more than 112,000 acres in Virginia’s western mountains – up"
"from the 74,000 acres defoliated a year ago. The hemlock woolly adelgid continues in its quest to eliminate"
hemlock trees from the Commonwealth. The emerald ash borer – a major threat to millions of ash trees in
"the state – has been found in northern Virginia. Invasive plants, such as ailanthus, Chinese privet, kudzu"
"and multiflora rose, are wreaking havoc in our forests and will likely change entire ecosystems where they"
are found.
Wildland fire activity was unusually high this year. Persistent drought conditions necessitated a statewide
"burning ban in the fall of 2007. In early February 2008, the Commonwealth experienced its busiest single"
day of fire activity ever as more than 350 wildland fires broke out February 10th. Two VDOF firefighters were
"seriously injured battling separate blazes during the year. And last, but certainly not least, are the continuing"
challenges we face with our workforce: nearly 40 percent of Agency employees have been with VDOF less
"than five years; the annual turnover rate is just under 27 percent, and the reason why more than 38 percent"
of those who left the Agency within the past five years was for better-paying positions.
"On the positive side, we dedicated two new state forests (Channels and Dragon Run), thereby adding more"
"than 6,000 acres to the self-funding state forest system. We created a Division of Forestland Conservation"
within the Agency and have already secured conservation easements on several thousand acres of privately
held forest land. We grew and sold more than 33 million tree seedlings; oversaw the regeneration of nearly
"81,000 acres of forest land, and partnered with several private entities (including Vaughan-Bassett Furniture"
"Co., Glatfelter Pulpwood Co., Plow & Hearth Co., and Belfort Furniture) to provide more than 563,000"
"free tree seedlings to Virginia landowners. Our wildland firefighters protected more than 2,200 homes"
"and other structures from the ravages of wildland fires. And we conducted more than 5,000 timber harvest"
inspections to ensure Virginia’s waters were protected.
"Lastly, the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service at the University of Virginia completed a study in 2008"
"of the economic impact of forestry in Virginia. According to the study, the value of Virginia’s forests exceeds"
"$27.5 Billion annually. There are more than 373,000 private forest landowners in the Commonwealth. Those"
"who harvest trees together receive more than $350 million annually for their timber. And 144,000 Virginians"
(1 out of every 33 workers) are employed in forestry-related industry jobs. Forestry and the forest industry
are big business in the Commonwealth.
I invite you to read through this document to fully understand: the state of Virginia’s forests; the Virginia
"Department of Forestry’s role in the protection and development of healthy, sustainable forest resources,"
and the impact Virginia’s forests have on your quality of life. Thank you for your continued interest in and
support of the Virginia Department of Forestry.
"Sincerely,"
Carl E. Garrison III

Protecting
Virginia’s Water Quality
Water quality is important to all Virginians. Studies have shown
that the cleanest water comes from forested watersheds. These
"watersheds are critical sources of pure drinking water, habitat for"
"important fisheries, and areas that are treasured for their recreational"
value and purity of life. Two of the Department’s important
measures involve water quality. One focuses on Best Management
Practices on forest harvesting operations and protecting streams
from sediment. The other focuses on improving and protecting
watersheds through management and land conservation.
The Virginia Department of Forestry has been involved with the
protection of our forested watersheds since the early 1970s with the
development of our first set of Forestry Best Management Practices
(BMPs) for Water Quality. The Department is now utilizing the
"fourth edition of those guidelines, and has circulated copies of"
its latest version nationwide as well as to numerous countries
worldwide. The backbone for the Department’s water quality effort
is the harvest inspection program which began in the mid-‘80s.
This program has provided for one-on-one contact between VDOF
and the harvest operators and a welcomed opportunity to educate
the operators on BMPs and the latest in water quality protection
"techniques. In fiscal year 2008, VDOF field personnel inspected"
"5,071 timber harvest sites across Virginia on 241,328 acres."
Another main focus of the VDOF water quality program is logger
education. Since the development of the first BMP Manual for
"Virginia, the VDOF has been involved in the training of harvesting"
contractors in water quality protection techniques ranging from
"harvest planning, map reading and the use of GPS units to BMP"
implementation. This occurred through training that the agency
"sponsored and, more recently, through VDOF participation in the"
SFI® SHARP (Sustainable Harvesting and Resource Professional)
"Logger Training Program. Since 1996, this program has enabled"
"VDOF to assist in training 6,202 harvesting professionals in 185"
different programs relating to water quality protection. For fiscal
"year 2007, there were 15 training programs offered with 402"
attendees present. Five of these courses were in the core area
"with 116 attendees, and the remaining 10 courses were for logger"
continuing education and had 286 attendees.
"In July 1993, the General Assembly of Virginia with"
"the support of the forest industry,"
enacted

"all 2,400 Web pages were individually coded to make them “Level"
"3” compliant, even though we were required to be only Level 1"
"compliant. By taking our site to Level 3 compliance, people with"
an impairment who might otherwise have trouble accessing and
reading information on our Web site will be able to see all of our
content through their Web browser.
