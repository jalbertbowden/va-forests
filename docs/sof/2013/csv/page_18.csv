"Like our tree improvement research, much of the study of pine silviculture",
is leveraged by our memberships in research cooperatives. An outstanding,
"example of this collaboration is the PineMap study, which focuses on the",
20 million acres of planted pine forests managed by private landowners,
from Virginia to Texas. We host one of the four field study locations at our,
"Appomattox-Buckingham State Forest, with a goal of harnessing productivity",
"to mitigate atmospheric carbon dioxide, more efficiently utilize nitrogen",
"and other fertilizer inputs, and adapt forest management approaches to",
"increase resilience in the face of changing climate. After just two years, the",
"test is yielding valuable information. For example, we have learned that",
nitrogen applied as fertilizer is being taken up by trees throughout the,
growing season (primarily into the leaves) and that more is available when,
fertilizer is applied in the winter instead of the summer. Early indications,
from a second effort indicate that our current models may be overestimating,One of VDOF’s progeny test plots on the

"hardwood planting, planted seedling size, and tree shelters. During 2012,",
we collaborated with Virginia Tech and NC State University to establish,
trials looking for promising hybrid poplar or eucalyptus families for short-,
"rotation planting in central Virginia. With permission from MeadWestvaco,",
we re-measured a 14-year-old hardwood species study that showed wide,
"ranging performance in both growth and survival, highlighting the need to",
match the species to the site when considering short-rotation planting for,
biomass / bioenergy production. The best species in that test averaged more,
than eight inches in diameter and nearly 80 feet in height at age 14. The 2012,
"cold-hardy hybrid poplar test is quite promising, with excellent survival of",
all families and excellent height growth (approaching 15 feet in less than,
"two years for trees in some families). Combined, these tests demonstrate",
