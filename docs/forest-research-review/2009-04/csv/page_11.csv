Hardwood Silviculture,
,The Effects of Crown-Touching
,Release and Fertilization on
,Growth of Southern Red Oak
,"As reported in last spring’s issue of the Research Review, we"
,installed a test in early 2007 to determine the responses of
,southern red oak to a second crop tree release treatment with and
,without the addition of fertilizer [200 pounds of N (as ammonium
,nitrate) plus 25 pounds of P (as DAP) per acre – Figure 13].
,"After two years, the diameter response to the fertilization treatment"
,"continues (Figure 14). And as Figure 15 shows, that response is"
,increasing. The 0.52 inches of dbh growth on the fertilized trees
,in the two years since treatment exceeds that in those released
,only (0.34 inches) by more than 50 percent. These results in
,combination with our other crop tree release work (e.g. the March
,"2007 Research Review), give us growing hope that these tools"
,– perhaps repeated at some yet-to-be-determined frequency –
,may give us the chance to improve the species composition of
,our hardwood stands while substantially shortening the rotation
,length. We plan to expand our work in this
,subject area.
