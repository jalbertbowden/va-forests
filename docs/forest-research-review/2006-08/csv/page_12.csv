seedlings in the large class. The study is a completely,
randomized design using individual-tree plots (Figure,Figure 3. Northern red oak seedling
2). The seedlings were planted at an approximate 10 x,emerging from a 4-foot tree shelter two
10 foot spacing in holes drilled using a 12-inch auger.,months after planting.
"Within two months of planting, some of the larger",
seedlings had already grown above the tops of the,
4-foot Tubex shelters (Figure 3). We will continue to,
monitor survival and growth of these trees to try and,
develop recommendations for the most cost-effective,
establishment methods.,
