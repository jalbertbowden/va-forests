"It’s been a busy six months since our last publication. In October, we helped to host",
the conference “Northern Limits – Restoring the Longleaf Pine Ecosystem in Virginia”,
"in Wakefield. Also in October, we completed collection of our loblolly pine second",

pounds of seed for the future seedling crops from our Garland Gray Nursery. With,
"help from the Forest Nutrition Cooperative, we began installation in December of","Jerre Creighton, research"

"combination with fertilization. Before tree growth resumes in the spring, we will also",
"remeasure VDOF’s mid-rotation fertilizer tests, as well as a MeadWestvaco density",
"and fertilization trial. And just this week, we installed multiple locations of a study to",
look at the effects of new insecticides for controlling tipmoth in young loblolly pine.,
"In this issue, you’ll find summaries of recent information gathered from tests of",
clonal loblolly pine plantations; performance in Virginia of loblolly and longleaf pine,
from various geographic seed sources; early effects of biosolid applications on,
loblolly pine growth; growth of loblolly pine seedlings interplanted in understocked,
"one-year-old plantations, and responses of southern red oak to crop tree release","rWesaeyanrec hB foowremstaenr,"
and fertilization. And we’re introducing a new feature highlighting the results of our,
collaborations with research cooperatives. We’ll take time in each issue to summarize,
"recent reports from the various cooperatives in which VDOF is a member, including",
"the Tree Improvement, Forest Nutrition, and Growth and Yield cooperatives. We",
hope you’ll find the information interesting and useful.,
