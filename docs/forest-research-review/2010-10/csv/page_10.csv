increasing pine growth. The herbicide release doubled,
"the volume yield compared to no treatment, which",
is a pretty encouraging result. But chemical site prep,
more than doubled the response compared to release,
"(Figure 9). Moreover, this was on a tract that was site",
prep burned just weeks prior to the first of the site prep,
application. There was virtually no leaf area present at,
"the first (July) application, and not much more by the",
time of the October treatments we measured (Figure,
10). But the hardwood competition was heavy at this,
site (typical of Piedmont Virginia sites) and proved the,
value of competition control for those landowners,
wanting to maximize pine growth (cover photo). We,
look forward to bringing you a more comprehensive,
analysis of this test following the fifth growing season.,
