"Pine Silviculture, continued"
interplants: 90 percent or more of them continue to
survive; they are taller at age two in the field (after
the 2009 growing season) than the original seedlings
were at the same age (after the 2008 growing season);
"and in the past year, they have grown roughly the"
same amount as the originals – not enough to catch
"up, but the difference between the two ages is leveling"
off (Figure 4).

seedling (right) in July 2010 at age 4 from planting.
