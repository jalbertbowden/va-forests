•,"In April, we completed VDOF’s first effort at mass-controlled pollination (MCP) for",
,loblolly pine seed production (described in the last issue). We could have as many as,
,one million MCP seedlings for our nursery crop in 2011.,
•,"In late August, 20 bushels of shortleaf cones were collected from the orchard at New",
,Kent Forestry Center through a collaborative project with Virginia State University.,
,Seed from this effort will be used to install a test to compare seedlings from our,
,orchard to those from other geographic locations.,
•,"In September, native Virginia longleaf cones were collected from trees on International",
,"Paper’s South Quay property south of Franklin, VA. Sixty-one bushels of cones were",
,collected and will provide seedlings over the next several years for reforestation,"Wayne Bowman,"
,projects in the original native range of longleaf in Virginia.,research forester
•,"Also in September, more than 440 bushels of loblolly pine cones were gathered",
,from 350 trees at the New Kent Forestry Center’s third-cycle loblolly orchard. Seed,
,from these cones will yield some of the fastest-growing and best-formed loblolly,
,"seedlings VDOF has ever produced, and will be a significant part of the nursery’s",
,crop in 2011.,

"Without fertilizer treatment, release alone resulted in",
"less height growth than no release. Diameter growth,",
"meanwhile, was improved significantly with release",
and even more with the addition of fertilizer. But,
through two years there is a clear response in diameter,
"growth to both release and fertilization. Moreover,",
the difference between either release or release plus,
fertilizer and the untreated trees continues to increase,
"(Figure 10). However, the response to the added",
fertilizer has begun to diminish; beginning in the third,
"year after treatment, fertilized trees have not grown",
any faster than those that were only released.,
