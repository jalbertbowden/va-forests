•,"In April, we completed VDOF’s first effort at mass-controlled pollination (MCP) for",
,loblolly pine seed production (described in the last issue). We could have as many as,
,one million MCP seedlings for our nursery crop in 2011.,
•,"In late August, 20 bushels of shortleaf cones were collected from the orchard at New",
,Kent Forestry Center through a collaborative project with Virginia State University.,
,Seed from this effort will be used to install a test to compare seedlings from our,
,orchard to those from other geographic locations.,
•,"In September, native Virginia longleaf cones were collected from trees on International",
,"Paper’s South Quay property south of Franklin, VA. Sixty-one bushels of cones were",
,collected and will provide seedlings over the next several years for reforestation,"Wayne Bowman,"

•,"Also in September, more than 440 bushels of loblolly pine cones were gathered",
,from 350 trees at the New Kent Forestry Center’s third-cycle loblolly orchard. Seed,
,from these cones will yield some of the fastest-growing and best-formed loblolly,

,crop in 2011.,
