VDOF Research Program,
Welcome to the second issue of the Virginia Department of Forestry,
(VDOF) Forest Research Review. We’ll bring you up to date on the,
"most recent results from several ongoing studies, including information",
on establishment methods for shortleaf and eastern white pines and,
"northern red oak, release and fertilization of white oak, control methods",
"for tree-of-heaven, and long-term growth of thinned yellow-poplar.",
We also have compiled an overview of our 50+ year loblolly pine tree,
improvement research.,
"In this issue, you will find a number of articles reporting on study",
"installations, progress and results from around the state. We hope you",
will find this material useful. You may also want to browse through the,"Jerre Creighton, research program"
"publications and links provided on our Web site, where you can find the",manager
"complete text of all 124 VDOF Occasional Reports (dating from 1955),",
"fact sheets, analysis tools, and copies of recent journal publications. As",
"always, please feel free to contact the research program staff with any",
questions or suggestions you may have:,
