this for the spacing study yields some pretty interesting
"results (Figure 4), indicating that the most-dense stands"
would need thinning or harvest no later than age 11-
"12, whereas the least-dense stand could grow for 25"
years before growth falls below the threshold.

rotation of loblolly pine planted at a range of
densities at Appomattox-Buckingham State Forest
and never thinned.
Figure 4. Estimating rotation ages for unthinned loblolly pine at various planting
densities by comparing mean to periodic annual increments.
"Approximate rotations: 2,722 tpa – 11-12 years; 908 tpa –"
"15-16 years , 605 tpa – 20-21 years; 303"
tpa – 24-25 years.
