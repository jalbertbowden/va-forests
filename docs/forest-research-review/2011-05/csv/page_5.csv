,,,,,,,One of the most-visited locations on the Appomattox-
,,,,,,,Buckingham State Forest is our surviving replication
,,,,,,,of this test (Figure 2). Some results from that location
,,,,,,,demonstrate the overall study conclusions reported
,,,,,,,above. Figure 3 demonstrates how early production
,,,,,,,of wood fiber (albeit on smaller individual trees) for
,,,,,,,uses such as biomass or biofuels could be maximized
,,,,,,,"at very high densities, while planting fewer trees per"
,,,,,,,acre creates stands that can maintain their health and
,,,,,,,vigorous growth for a longer period and produce larger
,,,,,,,"individual trees while doing so. Notice how, by the end"
,,,,,,,"of the 25-year measurement period, the ranking of the"
,,,,,,,different densities has almost completely reversed (and
,,,,,,,the trend appears to be that the 303-tpa plots would
,,,,,,,soon surpass the 454-tpa stand).
,,,,,,,In addition to total stand volume and individual tree
,,,,,,,"size, planting density also dramatically affects the age"
