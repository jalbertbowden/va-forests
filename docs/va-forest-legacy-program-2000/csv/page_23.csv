IMPACTS OF TECHNOLOGY ON,
VIRGINIA’S FORESTS IN THE 19TH AND,
20TH CENTURIES,
"In the 19th century, settlers pushed west through the",
Piedmont and mountainous regions of Virginia.With them,
they brought the old notion of measuring progress by the,
amount of untamed forest they converted to pastoral and,
agricultural land.What was happening to all of these felled,
"trees? Most of it was used for firewood.In fact, at this time",
eighty to ninety percent of the wood removed from,
forests was used for fuel.The remaining lumber was used,
"as building material (Burdette, 1996).However, this",
progressively changed throughout the 19th century.,
With the advent of more efficient cast-iron wood burning,
