• Define Perpetuity. Look for ì buy back authority. Explore reasons why people might not want to be involved in this
program and resolve them. F
• The regions on the map are too arbitrary.B
• Main question is on the length of the Legacy Program.G
Other Suggestions and Comments
• Landowner should be allowed compensation if future condemnation by eminent domain occurs.G
• The map used should be redrawn to set the heavy populated areas away from the part of the forest land with less
population.G
• The program must include excellent record keeping and coordination with other conservation easement programs. D
• Our focus group had lots of tax(IRS) related questions. Landowners should get clear written answers for these questions.
D
• Program needs to be pared with other conservation easements.(2)D
• The preservationist's have gotten the Forest Service to stop cutting in the National Forest.When they find out tax
"money is being used for conservation easements, they will pressure the Forest Service to have timber harvesting"
stopped. E
"• I believe that the entire state should be a Forest Legacy Area, rather than pockets of Forest Conservation Areas.This"
would serve as a preventative measure in areas where development has just begun in areas with high existing develop-
"ment, where much of the land has already been consumed.The program may not be as effective.The question is"
whether the plan is proactive or a Band-Aid?E
• I think the highest priority must be given to forest land which provides significant ecological benefits. Such as large
intact native forests and wildlife travel corridors between these blocks. C.
• Keep it simple! C
• Will get back in touch with you soon on behalf of the Potomac Appalachian trails club. E
• You should give us one 10 minute break.E
"• Small pot of money presents a limited potential, therefore focus on unique, significant and vitally important lands. Don’t"
"use program for regular tracts. Focus on significant forests (unusual forest types, species, specimens and plant communi-"
ties.F
• There must be a term on buy back option for flexibility. F
• There should be a statewide law that will restrict tax increases. F
• Need to have some way of reassessing in 30-50 years and 75-99 years so its not in perpetuity. F
• Review the program by a panel. F
"• It should be looked at as a long term land use planning tool, and not at what trees are growing today.D"
• Restrict easements to those interested in working forests-not those interested in preservation/no harvest. C
• Keep expenses low-use local unpaid committees for evaluation and choice or properties. C
• We see a real need for purchase of development rights in the valley. C
• More money needed in this program. E
• Get started. If you go to a cost-beneficial analysis. Its great that you are preserving land but what about the areas that
are more threatened and in need of protection. Areas such as northern Virginia due to intense population growth. E
"• Define ""Development"" and ""Forest"" to maintain biodiversity. A"
• The easement must contain language that mandates all forest management is done in consultation w/VDOF.A
"• As a landowner, I am concerned about any ""enforcement"" penalties etc. that would not penalize future owners of the"
land. I would not sign into a program that would potentially penalize the new land owner and would also be concerned
that the property value would decrease with any potential financial liabilities. A
"• Lets produce high quality, high value hardwoods and give greater economic value to the forest as a forest. A"
"• I do not think the program should be used to purchase land outright, unless there was a very compelling reason. B"
"• Flexible framework that allows us to develop with other state, local and private programs that acquire easements or fee"
title lands. B
