STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
"Of Virginia’s 25.4 million acres, 15.4 million acres of forest are classified as timberland with an"
"additional 579,000 acres of parks, wilderness, and scenic and historic resources. These categories"
combine for an estimated 16 million acres available to the citizens of Virginia and the United
"States. As we enjoy this abundance of forestland, we also must realize that over 93,000 acres are"
lost annually from all land types to non-renewable conversion such as urban and suburban devel-
opment (NRI data).
The United States Forest Service (USFS) Forest Legacy Program assists state governments to iden-
tify and protect important private forest tracts. Privately owned forests offer valuable benefits
"including water quality, recreation opportunities, scenic and historic values, and wildlife habitat."
"The primary protection tool, the conservation easement, is an effective means of influencing the"
disposition of important forestland while continuing private ownership.
"In October, 1999, Governor James S. Gilmore III designated the Virginia Department of Forestry as"
the lead state agency to coordinate the Forest Legacy Program and prepare this Assessment of
"Need document. The following information summarizes Virginia’s forest resources, history, owner-"
"ship patterns, and cultural impacts. The Department has held seven public meetings to receive"
input on this program and to determine potential Forest Legacy areas. We have then designated
five Forest Legacy areas for your consideration.
The core premise of Virginia’s Assessment of Need is the promotion and integration of the
"""Working Forestlands"" concept into general forestland conservation efforts. We believe that"
"diverse, well-managed forests are the healthiest, and consequently, provide the most public bene-"
fits when protected from the economic pressure for development.
"We, at the Department of Forestry, trust this document fulfills the requirements of the Assessment"
of Need protocol as defined in the Forest Legacy Implementation Guidelines. We appreciate the
support of the United States Forest Service as we progress in the conservation of Virginia’s forest
landbase.

IMPACTS OF TECHNOLOGY ON,
VIRGINIA’S FORESTS IN THE 19TH AND,
20TH CENTURIES,
"In the 19th century, settlers pushed west through the",
Piedmont and mountainous regions of Virginia.With them,
they brought the old notion of measuring progress by the,
amount of untamed forest they converted to pastoral and,
agricultural land.What was happening to all of these felled,
"trees? Most of it was used for firewood.In fact, at this time",
eighty to ninety percent of the wood removed from,
forests was used for fuel.The remaining lumber was used,
"as building material (Burdette, 1996).However, this",
progressively changed throughout the 19th century.,

,Application – Information Sheet
"Nationwide, the traditional uses of private forest lands for such activities as timber and wood",
"product management, wildlife management and recreational use have declined at an alarming",
rate. The primary reasons for this decline have been the conversion of forested tracts to non-,
"forest uses (such as residential or commercial development), and from forest fragmentation (the",
breaking up of large forests into smaller tracts separated by non-forested lands). These dramatic,
"changes have had far reaching impacts beyond the loss of our forests, including decreased water",
"quality and quantity, decreased wildlife and habitat diversity, loss of recreational opportunities,",
and the loss of scenic vistas and historic resources. Virginia is suffering these losses also.,
"Public lands are increasingly relied upon to provide these resources and opportunities, but alone",
cannot possibly meet this demand.To help maintain the integrity and traditional uses of our “work-,
"ing forests”,",Congress created the Forest Legacy Program which allows the U. S. Department of
"Agriculture, through the Forest Service, in cooperation with state agencies, to acquire land or interest",
in land. All acquisitions are purchased at fair market value as determined by standardized govern-,
"ment appraisal methods, and are held by the Commonwealth of Virginia in perpetuity.The Forest",
"Legacy Program relies on the concept of a ""willing seller, willing buyer and no condemnation.""",

VIRGINIA FOREST LEGACY
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
JULY 2000
WHAT IS THE FOREST LEGACY PROGRAM?
"Virginia is one of the first southern states to initiate a new program called Forest Legacy, which aims to protect"
"and conserve important forests that are threatened by conversion to non-forest uses, such as development. Led by"
"the Virginia Department of Forestry, Forest Legacy will be an important tool for preserving Virginia’s forests"
through the anticipated coming years of continued growth. Forest Legacy is distinct from other conservation
programs in that it will focus specifically on important forest lands and will require a Stewardship Plan or a
Multiple Resource Plan for each tract accepted into the program.
"Authorized by the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 1978, Virginia may use Forest Legacy funds to purchase"
conservation easements or land. The Department of Forestry plans to focus most of its efforts on the purchase of
conservation easements as a way to enable conservation of the greatest amount of forest land.
Priority consideration will be given to threatened forest lands which have important values. These values will
"be defined with the assistance of the Public Participation Process, and may include such things as the ability"
"of the forest to protect water quality, fish and wildlife habitat, recreation, timber production, rare communi-"
"ties, or scenic and aesthetic values."
"Virginia is in the process of developing a proposal that it will submit for federal approval, and hopes to launch its"
"Forest Legacy program by early 2001. Once Virginia develops its Forest Legacy program, it will receive federal"
dollars that can benefit landowners and conservation in the Commonwealth.
WHAT IS THE ASSESSMENT OF NEED?
"Virginia is in the process of developing an ""Assessment of Need"" which it will submit as part of its overall"
proposal to the U.S. Forest Service. This Assessment of Need will:
• Document the specific need for a Forest Legacy Program in Virginia.
• Establish eligibility criteria particular to Virginia.
• Identify and delineate boundaries of forest areas meeting the eligibility requirements or designation as Forest
Legacy Areas.
• Recommend priority areas to the Forest Service and Secretary of Agriculture for inclusion in the Forest Legacy
Program.
• Include relevant information about both public and private forest lands. It will analyze how to best maintain the
integrity of forest lands for future generations.
"The Assessment of Need will be completed by the Department of Forestry in late August 2000, after all public"
"comment is compiled and incorporated. It will then be submitted to the State Forester, after which the State"
Forester will submit the complete Assessment to the United States Forest Service for review.
73
"WHAT IS A ""FOREST LEGACY AREA""?"
A Forest Legacy Area is a geographically defined part of the state where tracts of land will be eligible for protec-
tion under Forest Legacy.
"Virginia will establish its Forest Legacy Areas by identifying areas that contain environmentally important forests,"
and where those forests are most threatened by conversion to non-forest uses. Environmentally important forests
"may offer important geological features, mineral resources, wildlife habitat including threatened and endangered"
"species, cultural resources, recreational resources, timber management, and aesthetic and scenic values."
"While most states have chosen to define discreet Forest Legacy Areas within their state, some have designated"
the entire state as a Forest Legacy Area. The Department of Forestry will use the Public Participation Process to
provide input on the how Virginia’s Forest Legacy Areas should be defined.
HOW DOES THE PUBLIC PARTICIPATION PROCESS WORK?
Virginia is initiating a Public Participation Process to enable the interested public to submit comments on the
"Forest Legacy program, as it is being developed. These public comments will be included in the Assessment of"
"Need, which will then be submitted for review to the U. S. Forest Service."
"Specifically, the Virginia Department of Forestry has contracted with the UVA Institute for Environmental"
Negotiation to design and facilitate the state’s public participation process. The goals of this process will be to
"enable a wide range of interested stakeholders to provide comment, concerns, and suggestions to the"
Department of Forestry.
The Virginia Public Participation Process attempts to cast a broad net to invite a broad range of responses and
"feedback in a short amount of time. Public comment will be received in several different ways. ""Focussed Public"
"Discussions"" will be held in seven different regions of the state: Abingdon, Salem, Harrisonburg, Warrenton,"
"Farmville, Tappahannock, and Chesapeake. Persons representing different interests are being identified and"
"personally invited to these meetings so that representation of different interests is ensured. Also, notice of these"
meetings will be provided in local newspapers so that other interested persons may attend the meetings.
Another way in which public comment will be solicited is through a broad mailing by letter and email in which
interested persons will be informed about the program and invited to provide comment through a question-
"naire. Similarly, legislators, local governments, and organizations will be contacted. The questionnaire will be"
"available on the web, by email, or by postal mail."
Public input is specifically desired on 1) what parts of the state should be included in the Forest Legacy program
"as Forest Legacy Areas, and 2) the criteria for determining if a specific tract of land is eligible for program funding."
HOW WERE THE PARTICIPANTS FOR THE PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT PROCESS
"""FOCUSED PUBLIC DISCUSSIONS"" CHOSEN?"
The Department of Forestry was asked to provide names of persons who might represent the following interests:
"landowners, elected officials or local and county governments, forest industry, conservation and environmental organi-"
"zations, chambers of commerce, land trusts, cooperative extension, academic institutions, youth. The Institute for"
"Environmental Negotiation telephoned these people to extend personal invitations. During these calls, additional"
"names were often suggested and contacted. Additionally, newspaper advertisements for the meetings will invite"
other interested persons to attend.

SAMPLE CONFIRMATION LETTER TO
PARTICIPANTS IN FOCUSED PUBLIC DISCUSSIONS
Dear ____________________________:
I am writing to confirm your participation in a FOCUSSED Public Discussion concerning the Virginia Forest
Legacy Program. I thank you for your willingness to participate in this discussion. The main purpose of this meet-
"ing will be to obtain your ideas about what parts of the state should be included in the Forest Legacy program,"
and the criteria for determining whether a specific tract of land will be eligible for program funding.
"The meeting will be on Friday, July 21 from 9 AM to 11:30 PM at the Community Volunteer Fire Department"
"in Abingdon, VA. Attached is a map with directions to this location."
The Forest Legacy program is a federally-funded conservation program that is being developed in Virginia by
the Department of Forestry. The UVA Institute for Environmental Negotiation has been asked to design and facili-
tate the public participation process. We are holding seven FOCUSED Public Discussions in different geographic
areas of the state. Each Discussion will include up to fifteen persons representing different interests who have
"been personally invited, such as yourself, as well as other interested persons from the public."
"Persons who have been invited may represent the following interests: landowners, elected officials or local and"
"county governments, forest industry, conservation and environmental organizations, chambers of commerce, land"
"trusts, cooperative extension, academic institutions, youth. As a consequence, your participation is very important, as"
you may be the only person at the meeting capable of representing a particular interest group.
Enclosed is a Question and Answer fact sheet about Forest Legacy which will help prepare you for further
discussion at the meeting. We are looking forward to your presence at the upcoming Focussed Public Discussion.
If you have any questions please contact John Hoover or myself at (804) 924-1970.
"Sincerely,"

Clarification of Goals and Terms Needed
• Proactive or Band-Aid? It should be clear in the goal. E
• Too vague. How about how many acres and by when? And shouldn’t it include fee simple purchase with conser-
vation easement. E
"• Good. It doesn’t match the ""goal"" on the handout. That one is better. E"
"• I would like to see definitions of terms so that all participants are discussing the same ideas. ie. Forest, develop-"
"ment, land owner, ""values"". Who would oversee the management and are there funds and the manpower to"
enact this program?A
• Define forests broadly.B
• The proposed goal is fairly broad-consensus for what? Wood products?Habitat? Water quality?B
"• Be sure to define "" conserve Virginia’s forests"" broadly to reflect the public interest in maintaining urban, biolog-"
"ically diverse, natural forests, as well as working forests."
"• Conserve should be defined to include, but not limited to, working forests(production of forest products)."
Forests for this program should be defined so as to avoid(not necessarily prohibit) conversion of natural forests
to monoculture trees and plantations. A
• Some clarification of inter-relationships with other conservation programs(TVA Watershed)A
• How is this like the sale of mineral rights ?D
• Needs to have qualification that this program will be for multi-use so it is clear that in 100 years the program is
for harvesting too. F
"• The question of term versus ""forever"" is important. Determine what’s effective 100 years from now seems impos-"
sible. F
• Save indication that management and harvesting can and will occur. This statement may mislead that harvest-
ing can occur. F
Best Used With Other Programs and Tools
"• Leveraged with other conservation, negotiation and educational efforts, however, it becomes a more powerful"
"tool to affect perception. In my mind, its value is in catalysts not consumption. E"
• Best used in cooperation with other programs and agencies that protect land from development either by
purchase or easement. B
• To the extent practical link this program to other ongoing programs that relate to reasons for retaining forest
lands. This program should not be the prime tool but one of many tools. F
• Another tool in the toolbox and a modest one on its own. E
Use of Conservation Easements is a Good Idea
• Great! Much Needed! C
"• Great Idea! This will help people who want to protect their land, but can’t afford it. We need this. C"
"• Yes, particularly purchased easements rather than donated easements since purchased easements favor a"
landowner with modest means. C
• Excellent-no purchase in fee needed-keep land in private hands! C
• Virginia should get involved with this and should only use conservation easements. C
• Conservation easements are the best method to leverage funds. Fee simple is not a good idea. Non-profits such
as the Valley Conservation Council should be instrumental in the process because we are already established as
an easement-holding entity. Conservation easements benefit landowners of modest means. C
• I like it because it is a voluntary taking of property rights to accomplish conservation. E
• This is a timely program. A
• Easements will stretch the money further than fee simple purchase. F
• Use easements AND fee ownership-use fee particularly when next to other areas of public ownership. B
• Excellent idea to preserve open spaces. D

• Define Perpetuity. Look for ì buy back authority. Explore reasons why people might not want to be involved in this
program and resolve them. F
• The regions on the map are too arbitrary.B
• Main question is on the length of the Legacy Program.G
Other Suggestions and Comments
• Landowner should be allowed compensation if future condemnation by eminent domain occurs.G
• The map used should be redrawn to set the heavy populated areas away from the part of the forest land with less
population.G
• The program must include excellent record keeping and coordination with other conservation easement programs. D
• Our focus group had lots of tax(IRS) related questions. Landowners should get clear written answers for these questions.
D
• Program needs to be pared with other conservation easements.(2)D
• The preservationist's have gotten the Forest Service to stop cutting in the National Forest.When they find out tax
"money is being used for conservation easements, they will pressure the Forest Service to have timber harvesting"
stopped. E
"• I believe that the entire state should be a Forest Legacy Area, rather than pockets of Forest Conservation Areas.This"
would serve as a preventative measure in areas where development has just begun in areas with high existing develop-
"ment, where much of the land has already been consumed.The program may not be as effective.The question is"
whether the plan is proactive or a Band-Aid?E
• I think the highest priority must be given to forest land which provides significant ecological benefits. Such as large
intact native forests and wildlife travel corridors between these blocks. C.
• Keep it simple! C
• Will get back in touch with you soon on behalf of the Potomac Appalachian trails club. E
• You should give us one 10 minute break.E
"• Small pot of money presents a limited potential, therefore focus on unique, significant and vitally important lands. Don’t"
"use program for regular tracts. Focus on significant forests (unusual forest types, species, specimens and plant communi-"
ties.F
• There must be a term on buy back option for flexibility. F
• There should be a statewide law that will restrict tax increases. F
• Need to have some way of reassessing in 30-50 years and 75-99 years so its not in perpetuity. F
• Review the program by a panel. F
"• It should be looked at as a long term land use planning tool, and not at what trees are growing today.D"
• Restrict easements to those interested in working forests-not those interested in preservation/no harvest. C
• Keep expenses low-use local unpaid committees for evaluation and choice or properties. C
• We see a real need for purchase of development rights in the valley. C
• More money needed in this program. E
• Get started. If you go to a cost-beneficial analysis. Its great that you are preserving land but what about the areas that
are more threatened and in need of protection. Areas such as northern Virginia due to intense population growth. E
"• Define ""Development"" and ""Forest"" to maintain biodiversity. A"
• The easement must contain language that mandates all forest management is done in consultation w/VDOF.A
"• As a landowner, I am concerned about any ""enforcement"" penalties etc. that would not penalize future owners of the"
land. I would not sign into a program that would potentially penalize the new land owner and would also be concerned
that the property value would decrease with any potential financial liabilities. A
"• Lets produce high quality, high value hardwoods and give greater economic value to the forest as a forest. A"
"• I do not think the program should be used to purchase land outright, unless there was a very compelling reason. B"
"• Flexible framework that allows us to develop with other state, local and private programs that acquire easements or fee"
title lands. B
93
"• Include whole state, not just areas you pick. Are corporations and families with large acreage eligible.B"
• Department of Forestry: Beware of pressure to tailor program to satisfy political interests in NOVA at the expense of
"getting bang for buck in more rural, less threatened regions of the state.. ie. 1000 acres easement in NOVA= 10-20,000"
"acres in SWVA, but political kudos for DOF are greater with first option. B"
• Good meeting. C
