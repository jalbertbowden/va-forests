Clarification of Goals and Terms Needed
• Proactive or Band-Aid? It should be clear in the goal. E
• Too vague. How about how many acres and by when? And shouldn’t it include fee simple purchase with conser-
vation easement. E
"• Good. It doesn’t match the ""goal"" on the handout. That one is better. E"
"• I would like to see definitions of terms so that all participants are discussing the same ideas. ie. Forest, develop-"
"ment, land owner, ""values"". Who would oversee the management and are there funds and the manpower to"
enact this program?A
• Define forests broadly.B
• The proposed goal is fairly broad-consensus for what? Wood products?Habitat? Water quality?B
"• Be sure to define "" conserve Virginia’s forests"" broadly to reflect the public interest in maintaining urban, biolog-"
"ically diverse, natural forests, as well as working forests."
"• Conserve should be defined to include, but not limited to, working forests(production of forest products)."
Forests for this program should be defined so as to avoid(not necessarily prohibit) conversion of natural forests
to monoculture trees and plantations. A
• Some clarification of inter-relationships with other conservation programs(TVA Watershed)A
• How is this like the sale of mineral rights ?D
• Needs to have qualification that this program will be for multi-use so it is clear that in 100 years the program is
for harvesting too. F
"• The question of term versus ""forever"" is important. Determine what’s effective 100 years from now seems impos-"
sible. F
• Save indication that management and harvesting can and will occur. This statement may mislead that harvest-
ing can occur. F
Best Used With Other Programs and Tools
"• Leveraged with other conservation, negotiation and educational efforts, however, it becomes a more powerful"
"tool to affect perception. In my mind, its value is in catalysts not consumption. E"
• Best used in cooperation with other programs and agencies that protect land from development either by
purchase or easement. B
• To the extent practical link this program to other ongoing programs that relate to reasons for retaining forest
lands. This program should not be the prime tool but one of many tools. F
• Another tool in the toolbox and a modest one on its own. E
Use of Conservation Easements is a Good Idea
• Great! Much Needed! C
"• Great Idea! This will help people who want to protect their land, but can’t afford it. We need this. C"
"• Yes, particularly purchased easements rather than donated easements since purchased easements favor a"
landowner with modest means. C
• Excellent-no purchase in fee needed-keep land in private hands! C
• Virginia should get involved with this and should only use conservation easements. C
• Conservation easements are the best method to leverage funds. Fee simple is not a good idea. Non-profits such
as the Valley Conservation Council should be instrumental in the process because we are already established as
an easement-holding entity. Conservation easements benefit landowners of modest means. C
• I like it because it is a voluntary taking of property rights to accomplish conservation. E
• This is a timely program. A
• Easements will stretch the money further than fee simple purchase. F
• Use easements AND fee ownership-use fee particularly when next to other areas of public ownership. B
• Excellent idea to preserve open spaces. D
