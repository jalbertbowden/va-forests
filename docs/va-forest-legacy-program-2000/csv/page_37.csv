,Application – Information Sheet
"Nationwide, the traditional uses of private forest lands for such activities as timber and wood",
"product management, wildlife management and recreational use have declined at an alarming",
rate. The primary reasons for this decline have been the conversion of forested tracts to non-,
"forest uses (such as residential or commercial development), and from forest fragmentation (the",
breaking up of large forests into smaller tracts separated by non-forested lands). These dramatic,
"changes have had far reaching impacts beyond the loss of our forests, including decreased water",
"quality and quantity, decreased wildlife and habitat diversity, loss of recreational opportunities,",
and the loss of scenic vistas and historic resources. Virginia is suffering these losses also.,
"Public lands are increasingly relied upon to provide these resources and opportunities, but alone",
cannot possibly meet this demand.To help maintain the integrity and traditional uses of our “work-,
"ing forests”,",Congress created the Forest Legacy Program which allows the U. S. Department of
"Agriculture, through the Forest Service, in cooperation with state agencies, to acquire land or interest",
in land. All acquisitions are purchased at fair market value as determined by standardized govern-,
"ment appraisal methods, and are held by the Commonwealth of Virginia in perpetuity.The Forest",
"Legacy Program relies on the concept of a ""willing seller, willing buyer and no condemnation.""",
"For more information or assistance in filling out an application, please contact the Forest Legacy",
Program at the Virginia Department of Forestry at (804) 977-6555.,
