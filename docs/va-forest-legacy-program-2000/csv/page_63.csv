VIRGINIA FOREST LEGACY
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
JULY 2000
WHAT IS THE FOREST LEGACY PROGRAM?
"Virginia is one of the first southern states to initiate a new program called Forest Legacy, which aims to protect"
"and conserve important forests that are threatened by conversion to non-forest uses, such as development. Led by"
"the Virginia Department of Forestry, Forest Legacy will be an important tool for preserving Virginia’s forests"
through the anticipated coming years of continued growth. Forest Legacy is distinct from other conservation
programs in that it will focus specifically on important forest lands and will require a Stewardship Plan or a
Multiple Resource Plan for each tract accepted into the program.
"Authorized by the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 1978, Virginia may use Forest Legacy funds to purchase"
conservation easements or land. The Department of Forestry plans to focus most of its efforts on the purchase of
conservation easements as a way to enable conservation of the greatest amount of forest land.
Priority consideration will be given to threatened forest lands which have important values. These values will
"be defined with the assistance of the Public Participation Process, and may include such things as the ability"
"of the forest to protect water quality, fish and wildlife habitat, recreation, timber production, rare communi-"
"ties, or scenic and aesthetic values."
"Virginia is in the process of developing a proposal that it will submit for federal approval, and hopes to launch its"
"Forest Legacy program by early 2001. Once Virginia develops its Forest Legacy program, it will receive federal"
dollars that can benefit landowners and conservation in the Commonwealth.
WHAT IS THE ASSESSMENT OF NEED?
"Virginia is in the process of developing an ""Assessment of Need"" which it will submit as part of its overall"
proposal to the U.S. Forest Service. This Assessment of Need will:
• Document the specific need for a Forest Legacy Program in Virginia.
• Establish eligibility criteria particular to Virginia.
• Identify and delineate boundaries of forest areas meeting the eligibility requirements or designation as Forest
Legacy Areas.
• Recommend priority areas to the Forest Service and Secretary of Agriculture for inclusion in the Forest Legacy
Program.
• Include relevant information about both public and private forest lands. It will analyze how to best maintain the
integrity of forest lands for future generations.
"The Assessment of Need will be completed by the Department of Forestry in late August 2000, after all public"
"comment is compiled and incorporated. It will then be submitted to the State Forester, after which the State"
Forester will submit the complete Assessment to the United States Forest Service for review.
