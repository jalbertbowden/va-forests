"WHAT IS A ""FOREST LEGACY AREA""?"
A Forest Legacy Area is a geographically defined part of the state where tracts of land will be eligible for protec-
tion under Forest Legacy.
"Virginia will establish its Forest Legacy Areas by identifying areas that contain environmentally important forests,"
and where those forests are most threatened by conversion to non-forest uses. Environmentally important forests
"may offer important geological features, mineral resources, wildlife habitat including threatened and endangered"
"species, cultural resources, recreational resources, timber management, and aesthetic and scenic values."
"While most states have chosen to define discreet Forest Legacy Areas within their state, some have designated"
the entire state as a Forest Legacy Area. The Department of Forestry will use the Public Participation Process to
provide input on the how Virginia’s Forest Legacy Areas should be defined.
HOW DOES THE PUBLIC PARTICIPATION PROCESS WORK?
Virginia is initiating a Public Participation Process to enable the interested public to submit comments on the
"Forest Legacy program, as it is being developed. These public comments will be included in the Assessment of"
"Need, which will then be submitted for review to the U. S. Forest Service."
"Specifically, the Virginia Department of Forestry has contracted with the UVA Institute for Environmental"
Negotiation to design and facilitate the state’s public participation process. The goals of this process will be to
"enable a wide range of interested stakeholders to provide comment, concerns, and suggestions to the"
Department of Forestry.
The Virginia Public Participation Process attempts to cast a broad net to invite a broad range of responses and
"feedback in a short amount of time. Public comment will be received in several different ways. ""Focussed Public"
"Discussions"" will be held in seven different regions of the state: Abingdon, Salem, Harrisonburg, Warrenton,"
"Farmville, Tappahannock, and Chesapeake. Persons representing different interests are being identified and"
"personally invited to these meetings so that representation of different interests is ensured. Also, notice of these"
meetings will be provided in local newspapers so that other interested persons may attend the meetings.
Another way in which public comment will be solicited is through a broad mailing by letter and email in which
interested persons will be informed about the program and invited to provide comment through a question-
"naire. Similarly, legislators, local governments, and organizations will be contacted. The questionnaire will be"
"available on the web, by email, or by postal mail."
Public input is specifically desired on 1) what parts of the state should be included in the Forest Legacy program
"as Forest Legacy Areas, and 2) the criteria for determining if a specific tract of land is eligible for program funding."
HOW WERE THE PARTICIPANTS FOR THE PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT PROCESS
"""FOCUSED PUBLIC DISCUSSIONS"" CHOSEN?"
The Department of Forestry was asked to provide names of persons who might represent the following interests:
"landowners, elected officials or local and county governments, forest industry, conservation and environmental organi-"
"zations, chambers of commerce, land trusts, cooperative extension, academic institutions, youth. The Institute for"
"Environmental Negotiation telephoned these people to extend personal invitations. During these calls, additional"
"names were often suggested and contacted. Additionally, newspaper advertisements for the meetings will invite"
other interested persons to attend.
