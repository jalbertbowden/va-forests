STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
"Of Virginia’s 25.4 million acres, 15.4 million acres of forest are classified as timberland with an"
"additional 579,000 acres of parks, wilderness, and scenic and historic resources. These categories"
combine for an estimated 16 million acres available to the citizens of Virginia and the United
"States. As we enjoy this abundance of forestland, we also must realize that over 93,000 acres are"
lost annually from all land types to non-renewable conversion such as urban and suburban devel-
opment (NRI data).
The United States Forest Service (USFS) Forest Legacy Program assists state governments to iden-
tify and protect important private forest tracts. Privately owned forests offer valuable benefits
"including water quality, recreation opportunities, scenic and historic values, and wildlife habitat."
"The primary protection tool, the conservation easement, is an effective means of influencing the"
disposition of important forestland while continuing private ownership.
"In October, 1999, Governor James S. Gilmore III designated the Virginia Department of Forestry as"
the lead state agency to coordinate the Forest Legacy Program and prepare this Assessment of
"Need document. The following information summarizes Virginia’s forest resources, history, owner-"
"ship patterns, and cultural impacts. The Department has held seven public meetings to receive"
input on this program and to determine potential Forest Legacy areas. We have then designated
five Forest Legacy areas for your consideration.
The core premise of Virginia’s Assessment of Need is the promotion and integration of the
"""Working Forestlands"" concept into general forestland conservation efforts. We believe that"
"diverse, well-managed forests are the healthiest, and consequently, provide the most public bene-"
fits when protected from the economic pressure for development.
"We, at the Department of Forestry, trust this document fulfills the requirements of the Assessment"
of Need protocol as defined in the Forest Legacy Implementation Guidelines. We appreciate the
support of the United States Forest Service as we progress in the conservation of Virginia’s forest
landbase.
