SAMPLE CONFIRMATION LETTER TO
PARTICIPANTS IN FOCUSED PUBLIC DISCUSSIONS
Dear ____________________________:
I am writing to confirm your participation in a FOCUSSED Public Discussion concerning the Virginia Forest
Legacy Program. I thank you for your willingness to participate in this discussion. The main purpose of this meet-
"ing will be to obtain your ideas about what parts of the state should be included in the Forest Legacy program,"
and the criteria for determining whether a specific tract of land will be eligible for program funding.
"The meeting will be on Friday, July 21 from 9 AM to 11:30 PM at the Community Volunteer Fire Department"
"in Abingdon, VA. Attached is a map with directions to this location."
The Forest Legacy program is a federally-funded conservation program that is being developed in Virginia by
the Department of Forestry. The UVA Institute for Environmental Negotiation has been asked to design and facili-
tate the public participation process. We are holding seven FOCUSED Public Discussions in different geographic
areas of the state. Each Discussion will include up to fifteen persons representing different interests who have
"been personally invited, such as yourself, as well as other interested persons from the public."
"Persons who have been invited may represent the following interests: landowners, elected officials or local and"
"county governments, forest industry, conservation and environmental organizations, chambers of commerce, land"
"trusts, cooperative extension, academic institutions, youth. As a consequence, your participation is very important, as"
you may be the only person at the meeting capable of representing a particular interest group.
Enclosed is a Question and Answer fact sheet about Forest Legacy which will help prepare you for further
discussion at the meeting. We are looking forward to your presence at the upcoming Focussed Public Discussion.
If you have any questions please contact John Hoover or myself at (804) 924-1970.
"Sincerely,"
Tanya Denckla
Senior Associate
"P.S. If you are no longer able to participate in this meeting, please call us as soon as possible at 804/ 924-1970 so"
"that we may invite another person who will represent similar interests. Also, we welcome suggestions for such a"
replacement. Thank you!
