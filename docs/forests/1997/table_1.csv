"Forest Health Highlights 1997
    Virginia
    The Virginia Department of Forestry provides forest health protection
    assistance to state and private land managers within the State. This program is funded
    cooperatively by the State and the USDA Forest Service Forest Health Protection unit.
    
      
    Virginia Forest Facts
      Over 
        66% of Virginia is forested (more than 15.2 million acres).
      Almost 
        85% of forested acreage in Virginia is privately owned. 
      
      The 
        George Washington and Jefferson National Forests (1.4 million 
        acres) provide recreational and wildlife benefits as well as timber products 
        and jobs for thousands of people. 
      Gypsy 
        moth defoliation started to affect Virginia's hardwood forests in 
        1984 and became an increasingly serious problem on the next decade. However, 
        an introduced fungal disease decimated gypsy moth caterpillars in 1996 
        and defoliation was so light that it could not be mapped. The same was 
        true in 1997 and little defoliation is expected in l998.
      Since 
        1993, Virginia has participated with the USDA Forest Service in a pilot 
        project to demonstrate that the rate at which the gypsy moth spreads into 
        new areas could be reduced in a cost effective manner using current technology. 
        Several intervention projects have taken place within the state over the 
        past 4 years and the results indicate that the rate of spread of the gypsy 
        moth can be slowed by 60%.
      Southern 
        pine beetle (SPB) infestations were at low levels in 1997. This cyclic 
        insect sometimes kills millions of board feet in timber statewide. Cooperative 
        state-federal monitoring programs help ensure that personnel and budgets 
        are prepared to deal with predicted outbreaks. The outlook for 1998 is 
        for relatively low populations. 
      Oak 
        decline is impacting Virginia's upland hardwood forests. Casual factors 
        are stressors such as drought, frost, and defoliation by insects, and 
        root disease. Oak decline and gypsy moth defoliation often overlap and 
        that leads to higher levels of oak mortality.
      The 
        hemlock woolly adelgid was first reported in Virginia in 1950. 
        This insect has now spread across most of the State infesting and killing 
        eastern hemlock. State and federal officials are investigating both chemical 
        and biological control methods for limiting the impact of the adelgid 
        in high value areas.
      Virginia 
        is actively participating in a national Forest Health Monitoring program. 
        Through a network of 100 forested plots and regularly scheduled surveys, 
        the Department of Forestry annually collects and interprets a wide variety 
        of data to estimate current health of the forest.
     
    The Virginia Department of Forestry 
    and USDA Forest Service
    In spite of the relatively good health of Virginia's forests, a variety of
    insects and diseases (both native and introduced), and human-caused impacts such as air
    pollution, continue to threaten the State's resources. To deal with this constantly
    changing mix of challenges, the Virginia Department of 
    Forestry and the Forest Health Protection unit of the USDA Forest Service cooperate to
    prevent, detect, suppress and manage this multitude of threats. The partnership between
    the two agencies has worked for three decades to maintain and improve the health of
    Virginia's forests.
