"The e me ra ld a sh b o re r continues to spread, albeit not as quickly as might have been predicted based on spread rates in other"
"parts of the country. With the widespread trapping effort by the Virginia Department of Agriculture this year, it has been"
"detected in two additional counties in northern Virginia, Frederick"
and Prince William. Neither find was a surprise since the Frederick
"county spots were close to Morgan County, WV where an infestation"
has been known for two years. The new finds in Frederick County
"were near Route 522, which extends north into WV. The Prince"
William County find was near the northern end close to Fairfax
"County, where infestations were detected in 2008. Frederick County,"
Clarke County (where EAB has not been detected) and Prince
"William County have been added to the list of quarantined counties,"
"including Loudoun, Fauquier, Fairfax, and Arlington. The city of"
"Winchester, likewise, has been added to the list of quarantined"
"David Cappaert, Michigan State Univ., Bugwood.org"
"municipalities including Manassas, Manassas Park, Falls Church, and"
Vienna.
"F a ll w ebw o r m, Hyp h a n tre a c u n e a : For the second year in a row, an"
unusually large and severe outbreak of fall webworm has occurred
along Skyline Drive in Shenandoah National Park. This outbreak is
"mostly affecting black cherry, which is very abundant in that area."
"Also affected are apple, hickory, and basswood. Hickory is probably"
more preferred in general but there seems to be much less of it in this
area compared to cherry. While the infestation is not as severe as last
"year, it is still pretty impressive to see all that webbing covering trees."
"In addition, while fall webworm typically is not lethal to trees, in this"
"case the severity of the outbreak and the location on high altitude,"
rough terrain and perhaps the influence of drought have taken a toll on
many cherries. Mortality of black cherry is scattered but significant.
