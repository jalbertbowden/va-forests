"T h e h emlo c k w ooly a d e lg id continues to cause significant hemlock decline in many areas, although trees in some areas that"
have supported infestations for many years are still hanging on. The adelgid continues to spread and has more-or-less permeated
"the entire range of hemlock within Virginia, minus a few pockets here and there. Hemlock mortality levels average about 16%"
in the southwest portion of the Commonwealth from Bath and Rockbridge counties southwest to Lee County. The release of
predators of the adelgid is on-going in Virginia and other states and offers some long-term hope of reducing the impacts of the
adelgid on the hemlock resource. We look to release beetles on a couple of our state forests in the near future.
S to r m d a ma g e : Significant storm damage from three major snow/ice/wind storms was reported for hardwoods and pines across
"a large area. Between December 2009 and February 2010, three unusually severe winter storms resulted in a record-breaking 55"
inches of snow for the season in Central Virginia. Most areas across the Commonwealth received record-breaking snowfall
"from at least one of these storms. Widespread damage was reported from the following counties: Appomattox, Carroll, Floyd,"
"Fluvanna, King and Queen Loudoun, Orange, Russell and Wise. The greatest axis of damage extended from southwest Virginia"
"into the central Piedmont. Total damage reported was 5,500 acres, 5,000 of which were from Carroll County alone. This is"
likely only a fraction of the actual damage but provides some indication of the impact of these storms.
"W e e d co n tro l w o rk o n sta te f or e sts: Over the last few years, I have"
supported a number of chemical weed control and site restoration
"projects on some of our state forests, including the Lesesne, Paul,"
"Whitney, and Conway Robinson. In some cases, following a harvest, a"
concerted effort to control invasive weeds is necessary in order to
successfully establish a new planting. Aggressive follow-up efforts are
"often needed as well since some of these plants, such as Ailanthus"
"(right) and oriental bittersweet, are particularly fast growing when"
"suddenly exposed to full sunlight. On the Lesesne, a large area of junk"
hardwoods with a heavy Ailanthus component was harvested and
chemically treated to prevent Ailanthus re-sprouting. Shortleaf pine
was planted to restore the site to a mixed pine-hardwood stand. On the
"Whitney, harvesting of mature loblolly and white pine stands exposed"
"a heavy undergrowth of Ailanthus and oriental bittersweet, which will"
need to be aggressively controlled prior to a new planting. These are
just a few examples of the forest management challenges that lie ahead when non-native invasive weeds are in the mix. We also
"produced signs for these locations that provide background on the invasive weed problem, what was done there and why, the"
"rationale behind clear-cutting as a silvicultural tool for pine, etc. We hope these sites can be used in perpetuity as educational"
"tools for the landowning public on how to go about maintaining a healthy, useful and productive forest despite the ubiquitous"
nature of invasive plants across our landscape. I hope to be able to maintain such projects on our state forests across the
Commonwealth from base US Forest Service funding into the future.
