            Health Highlights - 1999
        
        Virginia
        
        The Virginia Department 
          of Forestry provides forest health protection assistance to state and 
          private land managers within the Commonwealth.  Virginia and the USDA 
          Forest Service Forest Health Protection unit fund this program cooperatively.
        Virginia 
          Forest Facts
         
          Over 66% of Virginia is forested (more than 16 million 
          acres).
         
          Almost 85% of forested acreage in Virginia is privately owned.  
          
         
          The George Washington and Jefferson National Forests (1.4 
          million acres) provide recreational and wildlife benefits as well as 
          timber products and jobs for thousands of people. 
         
          Gypsy moth defoliation started to affect Virginia’s hardwood forests 
          in 1984 and became an increasingly serious problem over the next decade.  
          However, since 1996 an introduced fungal disease decimated gypsy moth 
          caterpillars and defoliation has been so light that it could not be 
          mapped.  
         
          Virginia participates with the USDA Forest Service in a project to slow 
          the rate at which the gypsy moth spreads into new areas.  It has 
          been demonstrated that this can be accomplished in a cost effective 
          manner using current technology.
         
          Southern pine beetle (SPB) infestations were at very low levels 
          in 1999. Cooperative state-federal monitoring programs help ensure that 
          personnel and budgets are prepared to deal with predicted outbreaks.  
          The outlook for 2000 is for relatively low populations. 
         
          Severe, summer drought in 1998 and 1999 contributed to increasing 
          pine mortality from infestations of pine engraver and black turpentine 
          beetles, and to the decline of mountain hardwoods.
         
          Oak decline is impacting Virginia’s upland hardwood forests.  Casual 
          factors are stressors such as tree age, drought, frost, and defoliation 
          by insects, and root disease.  Oak decline and gypsy moth defoliation 
          often overlap and that leads to higher levels of oak mortality.
         
          The hemlock woolly adelgid was first reported in Virginia in 
          1950.  This insect has now spread across most of the State infesting 
          and killing eastern hemlock. 
         
          Virginia is actively participating in a national Forest Health Monitoring 
          program.  Through a network of 100-forested plots and regularly 
          scheduled surveys, the Department of Forestry annually collects and 
          interprets a wide variety of data to assess forest health conditions.
        
        The Virginia 
          Department of Forestry and 
          USDA Forest Service
        In spite of the 
          relatively good health of Virginia’s forests, a variety of insects and 
          diseases (both native and introduced), and human-caused impacts such 
          as air pollution, continue to threaten the State’s resources.  To deal 
          with this constantly changing mix of challenges, the Virginia Department 
          of 
        Forestry and the 
          Forest Health Protection unit of the USDA Forest Service cooperate to 
          prevent, detect, suppress and manage this multitude of threats.  This 
          partnership has worked for more than 30 years to maintain and improve 
          the health of Virginia’s forests.
