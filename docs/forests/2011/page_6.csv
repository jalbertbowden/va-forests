"County, VA. The Knoxville, TN infestation has also crept further north by another couple of"
"counties and is right on the doorstep of Lee County, Virginia. Based on these developments, the"
next infested location in Virginia could be somewhere in the Southwest.
"The gypsy moth, as predicted, produced no significant defoliation this year that could be detected"
through aerial survey. Populations will likely remain low at least for the next two years.
"Consecutive dry spring weather will result in an upsurge in populations. For the last few years,"
"however, May has been a wet month, which means the fungus Entomophaga maimaiga is able to"
thrive and attack larval populations when they are most vulnerable. Dead larvae mean few adult
"moths, and that in turn means few egg masses next year. Few egg masses mean no detectable"
defoliation.
"As forecast by our spring trapping season,"
southern pine beetle activity continues to
be generally low across the
"Commonwealth, although localized"
activity has been picking up in a few areas.
"To date, we have approximately 300"
"reported acres killed for 2011, with the"
majority of that acreage coming from a
couple of locations where spots went
undetected and unreported and had been
growing for the last couple of years. They
were noticed during aerial survey flights by
"our staff, but it is very puzzling why"
nobody reported them to the Department of
Forestry. Both of these locations have
many similarities – maturing pine stands
"that were never thinned, sold by industry"
and subdivided. No spots were reported from national forest or other federal lands. Due to an
"excess of rain this year, the elevated Ips and turpentine beetle activity witnessed last year seems"
to have abated for the most part.
"We are approaching 35,000 acres treated under the Southern Pine Beetle Prevention Program"
in Virginia. A majority of this acreage is from cost-sharing with landowners for pre-commercial
"thinning, but also includes longleaf pine restoration and 1st commercial thinnings via our Logger"
Incentive Program. The US Forest Service’ SPB Prevention and Restoration Program has reached
a milestone this year in having reached one-million acres treated across the South. In
"commemoration of this milestone, we held a ceremony with USFS personnel at their request at"
"the end of October, 2011. It was held on a private landowners property in New Kent County,"
Virginia on a site that received a 1 st commercial thinning under our Logger Incentive Program
"during the last year. The Forest Service plan awarded the landowner, logging outfit, and"
consulting forester involved with the job a plaque in recognition of the importance of each of
these respective constituencies in maintaining good forestry practices. Efforts were made to bring
media attention to this event in order to bring further recognition to what good forest management
is all about and why it is important.
"Th e h eml o ck wo o l y a d el gid continues to cause significant hemlock decline in many areas,"
although trees in some areas that have supported infestations for many years are still hanging on.
The adelgid continues to spread and has more-or-less permeated the entire range of hemlock
"within Virginia, minus a few pockets here and there. Hemlock mortality levels average about"
