The emerald ash borer trapping survey was expanded
this year to cover a large swath of Virginia from the
"southwest to the east. Over 4,500 traps were placed in"
a 2x2 mile grid across this area by federal contractors
hired through USDA APHIS. While the federal survey
excluded trapping in the northern Virginia counties
"currently under the quarantine, limited trapping was"
done in Prince William and Fairfax by those respective
counties. While there were some positive traps in new
"locations, this only occurred in Fairfax and Prince"
"William counties, among those where EAB was"
already known to be present. No new detections
in new counties in Virginia have occurred
based on the 2011 survey. That’s the good
news. The bad news is that similar survey
efforts in adjacent states such as MD and WV
have shown a dramatic expansion in the
number of known infested counties just in the
"last year, with the expansion in southern West"
Virginia bringing it very close to Buchanan
