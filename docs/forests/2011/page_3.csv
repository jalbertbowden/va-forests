"Thousand cankers disease of black walnut, caused by a fungus (Geosmithia morbida) and"
"spread by the walnut twig beetle (Pityophthorus juglandis), is believed to have originated"
"throughout the southwestern U.S. (CA, AZ, NM, TX) and Mexico, throughout the ranges of four"
species of western walnuts. Presumably the twig beetle and the associated fungus made the jump
to eastern black walnut as planting of this species became more widespread in the West. The
"disease was first detected in Utah and Oregon in the 1990s, followed by New Mexico (2002),"
"Colorado (2003), California (2008), Washington (2008), Arizona (2009), and Idaho (2009). In"
"July 2010, fears that the beetle/fungus would find their way to the native range of eastern black"
"walnut were realized when TCD was detected in Knoxville, TN."
"During 2011, new TCD finds began to materialize in the East, first in the vicinity of Richmond,"
"Virginia in June, followed by the Philadelphia, PA area shortly thereafter."
"By June, the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS) had, with"
"numerous other states, already initiated a formal survey for TCD across the Commonwealth."
"Before the survey was very far under way, VDACS"
state plant pathologist Norman Dart was contacted
by Bartlett Tree Experts regarding a black walnut
exhibiting suspicious-looking symptoms. A
landowner on the southern outskirts of Richmond
had asked Bartlett to remove a large walnut tree
from his property that was mostly dead except for
one branch. The Bartlett staff who came to the
property had some training previously and were
alert enough to recognize the tell-tale but tiny holes
"created by walnut twig beetle, and the associated"
cankers characteristic of TCD. Samples submitted to
"Norm tested positive for TCD, while tiny bark"
beetles collected from galleries within the cankers were
"confirmed to be the walnut twig beetle by James Labonte, an entomologist with the Oregon"
Department of Agriculture.
"By July, notification was made statewide that VDACS had enacted a quarantine on black walnut"
"for Henrico, Chesterfield and the City of Richmond based on ongoing surveys that revealed"
"additional infestations. [TCD Chesterfield, TCD Hanover] Based on additional survey work"
"extending into fall, Hanover, Goochland and Powhatan counties will soon be added to the list as"
"well. According to the quarantine, regulated articles include any life stage of the walnut twig"
"beetle or the Geosmithia morbida pathogen, as well as ‘all plants and plant parts of the genus"
"Juglans including but not limited to nursery stock, budwood, scionwood, green lumber, firewood,"
"and other material living, dead, cut or fallen including stumps, roots, branches, mulch, and"
"composted and uncomposted chips.’ Specific exemptions include, but are not limited to ‘nuts, nut"
"meats, hulls, processed lumber (100% bark-free, kiln-dried, with squared edges), and finished"
"wood products without bark, including walnut furniture, instruments, and other items derived"
from the genus Juglans.’ VDACS can issue certificates or limited permits that allow for
movement of regulated articles if certain conditions are met.
"Virginia was beset with storms this year, from spring tornado outbreaks to late summer tropical"
systems such as Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee. Tornadoes touched down in many
"places this spring, with areas that were particularly hard hit including the town of Pulaski, town of"
"Abingdon, and numerous areas throughout Washington, Halifax, Rockingham, Shenandoah,"
