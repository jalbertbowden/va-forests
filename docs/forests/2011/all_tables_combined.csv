"Thousand cankers disease of black walnut, caused by a fungus (Geosmithia morbida) and"
"spread by the walnut twig beetle (Pityophthorus juglandis), is believed to have originated"
"throughout the southwestern U.S. (CA, AZ, NM, TX) and Mexico, throughout the ranges of four"
species of western walnuts. Presumably the twig beetle and the associated fungus made the jump
to eastern black walnut as planting of this species became more widespread in the West. The
"disease was first detected in Utah and Oregon in the 1990s, followed by New Mexico (2002),"
"Colorado (2003), California (2008), Washington (2008), Arizona (2009), and Idaho (2009). In"
"July 2010, fears that the beetle/fungus would find their way to the native range of eastern black"
"walnut were realized when TCD was detected in Knoxville, TN."
"During 2011, new TCD finds began to materialize in the East, first in the vicinity of Richmond,"
"Virginia in June, followed by the Philadelphia, PA area shortly thereafter."
"By June, the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS) had, with"
"numerous other states, already initiated a formal survey for TCD across the Commonwealth."
"Before the survey was very far under way, VDACS"
state plant pathologist Norman Dart was contacted
by Bartlett Tree Experts regarding a black walnut
exhibiting suspicious-looking symptoms. A
landowner on the southern outskirts of Richmond
had asked Bartlett to remove a large walnut tree
from his property that was mostly dead except for
one branch. The Bartlett staff who came to the
property had some training previously and were
alert enough to recognize the tell-tale but tiny holes
"created by walnut twig beetle, and the associated"
cankers characteristic of TCD. Samples submitted to
"Norm tested positive for TCD, while tiny bark"
beetles collected from galleries within the cankers were
"confirmed to be the walnut twig beetle by James Labonte, an entomologist with the Oregon"
Department of Agriculture.
"By July, notification was made statewide that VDACS had enacted a quarantine on black walnut"
"for Henrico, Chesterfield and the City of Richmond based on ongoing surveys that revealed"
"additional infestations. [TCD Chesterfield, TCD Hanover] Based on additional survey work"
"extending into fall, Hanover, Goochland and Powhatan counties will soon be added to the list as"
"well. According to the quarantine, regulated articles include any life stage of the walnut twig"
"beetle or the Geosmithia morbida pathogen, as well as ‘all plants and plant parts of the genus"
"Juglans including but not limited to nursery stock, budwood, scionwood, green lumber, firewood,"
"and other material living, dead, cut or fallen including stumps, roots, branches, mulch, and"
"composted and uncomposted chips.’ Specific exemptions include, but are not limited to ‘nuts, nut"
"meats, hulls, processed lumber (100% bark-free, kiln-dried, with squared edges), and finished"
"wood products without bark, including walnut furniture, instruments, and other items derived"
from the genus Juglans.’ VDACS can issue certificates or limited permits that allow for
movement of regulated articles if certain conditions are met.
"Virginia was beset with storms this year, from spring tornado outbreaks to late summer tropical"
systems such as Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee. Tornadoes touched down in many
"places this spring, with areas that were particularly hard hit including the town of Pulaski, town of"
"Abingdon, and numerous areas throughout Washington, Halifax, Rockingham, Shenandoah,"
"Dinwiddie, James City, York, Gloucester, and Middlesex Counties. During the most severe"
"tornado outbreak in Virginia, which occurred on April 27-28, the National Weather Service"
"confirmed 16 tornadoes. Of those, four were rated EF0, eight EF1, three EF2, and one EF3 in"
Washington County that was three quarters of a mile wide and touched down for 18 miles. While
"many communities were hard hit, aerial surveys revealed that overall forest damage was not too"
"extensive, with the exception of some localized pockets of severe blowdown. In total, our staff"
"reported 1246 acres of damaged forest throughout Virginia, although this is likely a considerable"
underestimate.
"Hurricane Irene blew through eastern Virginia over the August 26th-28 th weekend, maintaining"
Category 1 strength most of the way. While there were
widespread power outages due to downed trees and
"considerable flooding in places, it could have been much"
worse. Subsequent aerial survey revealed no widespread
catastrophic damage to core forested areas in general. Our
"folks reported a little over 450 acres of forest damage,"
although reporting was spotty and likely to be
underestimated considerably. Most places east of I-95 saw
"at least 5 inches of rain, while parts of 5 counties in"
southeastern Virginia saw 11-15 inches (Figure 1). To add
"insult to injury, less than two weeks later Tropical Storm"
Lee came straight up the I-95 corridor and dumped another
5 to 15 inches of rain in many locations in the northern coastal plain and northeastern piedmont
(Figure 2). This resulted in a number of places receiving up to 20 inches of rain in a two-week
period.
The emerald ash borer trapping survey was expanded
this year to cover a large swath of Virginia from the
"southwest to the east. Over 4,500 traps were placed in"
a 2x2 mile grid across this area by federal contractors
hired through USDA APHIS. While the federal survey
excluded trapping in the northern Virginia counties
"currently under the quarantine, limited trapping was"
done in Prince William and Fairfax by those respective
counties. While there were some positive traps in new
"locations, this only occurred in Fairfax and Prince"
"William counties, among those where EAB was"
already known to be present. No new detections
in new counties in Virginia have occurred
based on the 2011 survey. That’s the good
news. The bad news is that similar survey
efforts in adjacent states such as MD and WV
have shown a dramatic expansion in the
number of known infested counties just in the
"last year, with the expansion in southern West"
Virginia bringing it very close to Buchanan
"County, VA. The Knoxville, TN infestation has also crept further north by another couple of"
"counties and is right on the doorstep of Lee County, Virginia. Based on these developments, the"
next infested location in Virginia could be somewhere in the Southwest.
"The gypsy moth, as predicted, produced no significant defoliation this year that could be detected"
through aerial survey. Populations will likely remain low at least for the next two years.
"Consecutive dry spring weather will result in an upsurge in populations. For the last few years,"
"however, May has been a wet month, which means the fungus Entomophaga maimaiga is able to"
thrive and attack larval populations when they are most vulnerable. Dead larvae mean few adult
"moths, and that in turn means few egg masses next year. Few egg masses mean no detectable"
defoliation.
"As forecast by our spring trapping season,"
southern pine beetle activity continues to
be generally low across the
"Commonwealth, although localized"
activity has been picking up in a few areas.
"To date, we have approximately 300"
"reported acres killed for 2011, with the"
majority of that acreage coming from a
couple of locations where spots went
undetected and unreported and had been
growing for the last couple of years. They
were noticed during aerial survey flights by
"our staff, but it is very puzzling why"
nobody reported them to the Department of
Forestry. Both of these locations have
many similarities – maturing pine stands
"that were never thinned, sold by industry"
and subdivided. No spots were reported from national forest or other federal lands. Due to an
"excess of rain this year, the elevated Ips and turpentine beetle activity witnessed last year seems"
to have abated for the most part.
"We are approaching 35,000 acres treated under the Southern Pine Beetle Prevention Program"
in Virginia. A majority of this acreage is from cost-sharing with landowners for pre-commercial
"thinning, but also includes longleaf pine restoration and 1st commercial thinnings via our Logger"
Incentive Program. The US Forest Service’ SPB Prevention and Restoration Program has reached
a milestone this year in having reached one-million acres treated across the South. In
"commemoration of this milestone, we held a ceremony with USFS personnel at their request at"
"the end of October, 2011. It was held on a private landowners property in New Kent County,"
Virginia on a site that received a 1 st commercial thinning under our Logger Incentive Program
"during the last year. The Forest Service plan awarded the landowner, logging outfit, and"
consulting forester involved with the job a plaque in recognition of the importance of each of
these respective constituencies in maintaining good forestry practices. Efforts were made to bring
media attention to this event in order to bring further recognition to what good forest management
is all about and why it is important.
"Th e h eml o ck wo o l y a d el gid continues to cause significant hemlock decline in many areas,"
although trees in some areas that have supported infestations for many years are still hanging on.
The adelgid continues to spread and has more-or-less permeated the entire range of hemlock
"within Virginia, minus a few pockets here and there. Hemlock mortality levels average about"
19% in the southwest portion of the Commonwealth from Bath and Rockbridge counties,19% in the southwest portion of the Commonwealth from Bath and Rockbridge counties
