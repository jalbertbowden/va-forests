"Dinwiddie, James City, York, Gloucester, and Middlesex Counties. During the most severe"
"tornado outbreak in Virginia, which occurred on April 27-28, the National Weather Service"
"confirmed 16 tornadoes. Of those, four were rated EF0, eight EF1, three EF2, and one EF3 in"
Washington County that was three quarters of a mile wide and touched down for 18 miles. While
"many communities were hard hit, aerial surveys revealed that overall forest damage was not too"
"extensive, with the exception of some localized pockets of severe blowdown. In total, our staff"
"reported 1246 acres of damaged forest throughout Virginia, although this is likely a considerable"
underestimate.
"Hurricane Irene blew through eastern Virginia over the August 26th-28 th weekend, maintaining"
Category 1 strength most of the way. While there were
widespread power outages due to downed trees and
"considerable flooding in places, it could have been much"
worse. Subsequent aerial survey revealed no widespread
catastrophic damage to core forested areas in general. Our
"folks reported a little over 450 acres of forest damage,"
although reporting was spotty and likely to be
underestimated considerably. Most places east of I-95 saw
"at least 5 inches of rain, while parts of 5 counties in"
southeastern Virginia saw 11-15 inches (Figure 1). To add
"insult to injury, less than two weeks later Tropical Storm"
Lee came straight up the I-95 corridor and dumped another
5 to 15 inches of rain in many locations in the northern coastal plain and northeastern piedmont
(Figure 2). This resulted in a number of places receiving up to 20 inches of rain in a two-week
period.
