"Chesterfield, Hanover, Goochland, and Powhatan, plus the cities of Richmond and Colonial Heights. In 2012, with the"
"deployment, by VDACS, of walnut twig beetle pheromone traps across the Commonwealth, new TCD infestations were"
discovered in northern Prince William and Fairfax Counties in northern Virginia. This now makes two major metropolitan
areas in Virginia where WTB/TCD appear to be pretty widespread.
"According to the quarantine, regulated articles include any life stage of the walnut twig beetle or the Geosmithia morbida"
"pathogen, as well as ‘all plants and plant parts of the genus Juglans including but not limited to nursery stock, budwood,"
"scionwood, green lumber, firewood, and other material living, dead, cut or fallen including stumps, roots, branches,"
"mulch, and composted and un-composted chips.’ Specific exemptions include, but are not limited to ‘nuts, nut meats,"
"hulls, processed lumber (100% bark-free, kiln-dried, with squared edges), and finished wood products without bark,"
"including walnut furniture, instruments, and other items derived from the genus Juglans.’ VDACS can issue certificates or"
limited permits that allow for movement of regulated articles if certain conditions are met.
"The hemlock wooly adelgid continues to cause significant hemlock decline in many areas, although trees in some areas"
that have supported infestations for many years are still hanging on. The adelgid continues to spread and has more-or-less
"permeated the entire range of hemlock within Virginia, minus a few pockets here and there. Hemlock mortality levels"
average about 20% in the southwest portion of the Commonwealth from Bath and Rockbridge counties southwest to Lee
County. The release of predators of the adelgid is on-going in Virginia and other states and offers some long-term hope of
reducing the impacts of the adelgid on the hemlock resource. We continue to monitor releases of predator beetles for
biological control of the adelgid on a few of our State Forests and State Parks.
"For the third year in a row, we have reported 0 defoliated acres due to gypsy moth from aerial survey efforts, although 4"
acres worth of light to moderate defoliation were reported from ground observations. The wet spring of 2009 and the
resultant impact of Entomophaga maimaiga decimated gypsy moth populations across the Commonwealth. With
"successive wet springs each year since 2009, populations have not shown a significant resurgence to levels where"
"defoliation can occur on a wide scale. This trend should hold until we see successive dry spring weather, especially during"
"May, which will allow populations to gradually build up to damaging levels again."
The second year of an extensive cankerworm outbreak spanned a very large area covering much eastern Virginia. There
"was actually a mix of fall cankerworm, spring cankerworm, and a complex of other native defoliators in lesser amounts."
"The worst-hit areas included Chesterfield, Powhatan, Hanover and King William Counties in mostly rural and suburban"
"areas to the west and north of the Richmond city limits. In total,"
over 15 counties and a total area spanning over 2.5 million acres
"were variably impacted, although a majority of this was light and"
"patchy in nature. Approximately 246,000 acres were classified as"
"having heavy but patch defoliation, while an additional 14,000"
acres were severely and continuously defoliated. Most of the
"severely defoliated trees were chestnut oaks, while scarlet oak, red"
"maple, and beech also saw some moderate to heavy defoliation."
"Most trees refoliated and are expected to live through the event,"
but some mortality of oaks was reported. While fall cankerworm is
"a recurring native defoliator in Virginia, the extent of this outbreak"
is unprecedented as far as records go. Shape file data for this even
was submitted separately.
