"As forecast by our spring trapping season, southern pine beetle"
"activity continues to be generally low across the Commonwealth,"
although localized activity has been picking up in a few areas.
Numbers remain low in most places based on the spring trapping
"survey results and relatively few reports, although there has been"
"an increase in activity since last year. In total, 28 spots"
amounting to 323 acres of dead pine across 6 counties were
detected. A large majority of this acreage (xx ac) came from one
"area in western Hanover County where, last year, a spot within"
an unthinned pine stand that was converted into subdivisions and
had gone undetected for years was allowed to grow and was
never reported or dealt with. About 400 acres of this area was
"clear-cut and managed, but due to the complex ownerships and"
"insufficient cutting and removals, SPB has since spread to other"
adjacent properties. No spots were reported on federal land and
no counties were in outbreak status. Affected counties were concentrated in the far eastern Piedmont and western Coastal
Plain.
"We have exceeded 40,000 acres treated under the Southern Pine Beetle Prevention Program in Virginia. A majority of"
"this acreage is from cost-sharing with landowners for pre-commercial thinning, but also includes longleaf pine restoration"
and 1st commercial thinnings via our Logger Incentive Program.
