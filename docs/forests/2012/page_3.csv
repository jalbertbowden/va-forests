The emerald ash borer trapping survey was continued this year to cover a large swath of Virginia from the southwest to
"the east, approximately 2/3 of the entire state. Over 5,000 traps were placed in a 2x2 mile grid across this area by federal"
contractors hired through USDA APHIS. While the federal survey excluded trapping in the northern Virginia counties
"currently under the quarantine, trapping was also continued in Prince William and Fairfax by those respective counties"
governments.
"This has been a ‘breakout’ year for EAB in Virginia. Since 2008,"
EAB has been found only within the northern counties of
"Alexandria, Fairfax, Prince William and Frederick. Random"
discovery of new infestations and the results of this summer’s
"trapping effort, however, have produced finds in 13 additional"
"counties; these include Loudoun and Warren in the north,"
"Caroline, Spotsylvania and Hanover in the northeast, Prince"
"Edward, Pittsylvania, Halifax, Charlotte and Mecklenburg in the"
"south Central, and Lee, Buchanan and Giles in southwestern"
portions of Virginia. A federal quarantine for the entire state is
now in place. While most of these new finds were due to recovery
"of adults from the purple prism traps, new infestations with"
extensive tree mortality were also discovered in forested sites. One
"was an area spanning approximately 7,000 acres in far northern"
"Frederick County, bordering the West Virginia panhandle. The"
"other large area was along the Roanoke (Staunton) River, which"
represents the border of Halifax and Charlotte counties. Along a
5 mile stretch of river were thousands of dead ash trees. It looks
as though EAB had been present in this area at least five years
based on the number of dead trees scattered along 10 mile-15
miles of riverfront extending from the Staunton River to the
Dan River over to South Boston. It is likely that new
infestations will materialize soon in all these other locations
"where traps have revealed EAB to be present, although there is"
always some lag time between trap catch and identification of
infestations since EAB is quite cryptic until trees begin to die
and draw attention. Shape files of the one larger EAB
infestation along the Roanoke River were based on aerial
surveys and have been provided.
"Thousand cankers disease of black walnut, caused by a fungus"
(Geosmithia morbida) and spread by the walnut twig beetle
"(Pityophthorus juglandis), is believed to have originated"
"throughout the southwestern U.S. (CA, AZ, NM, TX) and Mexico,"
throughout the ranges of four species of western walnuts.
Presumably the twig beetle and the associated fungus made the
jump to eastern black walnut as planting of this species became
more widespread in the West. The disease was first detected in
"Utah and Oregon in the 1990s, followed by New Mexico (2002),"
"Colorado (2003), California (2008), Washington (2008), Arizona"
"(2009), and Idaho (2009). In July 2010, fears that the beetle/fungus"
would find their way to the native range of eastern black walnut
"were realized when TCD was detected in Knoxville, TN."
"Beginning in June 2011, positive identification of the fungus and"
"the associated walnut twig beetle occurred for five counties and two municipalities: these include the counties of Henrico,"
