Brood I (The Blue Ridge Brood) of the Periodical (17-year)
"cicada emerged in and along the Blue Ridge Mountains this May,"
"from east and west of the Roanoke area, up along the Blue Ridge,"
"Shenandoah Valley, and Appalachians north to around"
Harrisonburg. Many locations within this areas showed extensive
‘flagging’ of vegetation due to oviposition damage by the cicadas.
"In some instances, this flagging was heavy enough on mid-to upper"
"slopes that it could be seen from miles away, giving the foliage an"
off-color appearance as one would see with light defoliation. A
major emergence of Brood II across much of the Piedmont is
expected next spring.
