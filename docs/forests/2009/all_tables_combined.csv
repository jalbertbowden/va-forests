worth mentioning – this year was notable in that a pretty,
severe outbreak occurred in Shenandoah Park along,
Skyline Drive near Big Meadows. Most of the damage was,
"concentrated on black cherry, which was the predominant",

So ut he r n pi ne be e t l e ( SPB) numbers remain low in most places based on the spring trapping survey results
and relatively few reports. A few hotspot areas during the last couple of years seemed to have stabilized
"somewhat. In total, 25 spots amounting to 14,254 trees (average 570 trees per spot) and 71 acres across 7"
counties were detected. No spots were reported on federal land and no counties were in outbreak status.
"Affected counties were concentrated in the south-central Piedmont and included Caroline, Charlotte, Halifax,"
"Lunenburg, Nelson, Northampton and Nottoway."
SPB Pr e v e nt i o n Pr o g r am
"After approximately five years, the SPB Prevention Program has provided federal cost-share dollars for pre-"
"commercial thinning (PCT) on approximately 25,000 acres throughout Virginia. On July 1, we began a new"
logger incentive program for first thinning of small parcels between 10-40 acres in size. The logger incentive is
"not a cost-share payment but a direct, fixed payment of $2,000 per job. The rationale for this program is that"
small parcels are rarely profitable for loggers to travel to; the average cost of moving their equipment to a site is
"approximately $2,000. Therefore, it is much more difficult to entice a logger to visit a small parcel in need of a"
"thinning. With this incentive, we insure that the expanding acreage of pine parcels below 40 acres can also"
benefit from best management practices for mitigating bark beetle impacts.
"The he m l o ck wo o l l y a de l g i d continues to cause significant hemlock decline in many areas, although trees in"
some areas that have supported infestations for many years are still hanging on. Despite the continued spread
"into most areas of the range in Virginia, hemlock mortality levels have stabilized over the last five years. The"
release of predators of the adelgid is on-going in Virginia and other states and offers some long-term hope of
reducing the impacts of the adelgid on the hemlock resource.
"O a k de cl i ne, a bi o t i c a nd bi o t i c de cl i ne"
Oak and other hardwood decline continues to be widespread throughout the Commonwealth due to past
"drought, past storm events, and most recently, gypsy moth defoliation. Gypsy moth defoliation has affected a"
number of areas in the Appalachian mountains over multiple years. Many oak trees that were not killed outright
were subject to severe stress. These widespread stress factors led to tree mortality precipitated by numerous
"biotic agents, including Armillaria, Hypoxylon canker, ambrosia beetles, two-lined chestnut borer, oak carpenter"
"worm, and red-oak borer. This mortality has continued through 2009 and has likely been exacerbated in some"
"areas by drought, although the latter condition has abated for 2009."
St o r m Da ma g e
"Relatively little storm damage occurred compared to past years, although some surveyed locations registered"
small areas impacted by strong winds and hail. A hail storm in June defoliated almost 400 acres along Rt. 211
and the New Market Gap crossing over Massanutten Mountain. Other severe weather included a small outbreak
"of tornados in Campbell County in mid-July. Approximately 100 acres of oak, pine, and poplar were reported"
destroyed. Virginia was not impacted by any tropical systems in 2009.
