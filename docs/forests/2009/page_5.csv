So ut he r n pi ne be e t l e ( SPB) numbers remain low in most places based on the spring trapping survey results
and relatively few reports. A few hotspot areas during the last couple of years seemed to have stabilized
"somewhat. In total, 25 spots amounting to 14,254 trees (average 570 trees per spot) and 71 acres across 7"
counties were detected. No spots were reported on federal land and no counties were in outbreak status.
"Affected counties were concentrated in the south-central Piedmont and included Caroline, Charlotte, Halifax,"
"Lunenburg, Nelson, Northampton and Nottoway."

"After approximately five years, the SPB Prevention Program has provided federal cost-share dollars for pre-"
"commercial thinning (PCT) on approximately 25,000 acres throughout Virginia. On July 1, we began a new"
logger incentive program for first thinning of small parcels between 10-40 acres in size. The logger incentive is
"not a cost-share payment but a direct, fixed payment of $2,000 per job. The rationale for this program is that"
small parcels are rarely profitable for loggers to travel to; the average cost of moving their equipment to a site is
"approximately $2,000. Therefore, it is much more difficult to entice a logger to visit a small parcel in need of a"
"thinning. With this incentive, we insure that the expanding acreage of pine parcels below 40 acres can also"
benefit from best management practices for mitigating bark beetle impacts.
"The he m l o ck wo o l l y a de l g i d continues to cause significant hemlock decline in many areas, although trees in"
some areas that have supported infestations for many years are still hanging on. Despite the continued spread
"into most areas of the range in Virginia, hemlock mortality levels have stabilized over the last five years. The"
release of predators of the adelgid is on-going in Virginia and other states and offers some long-term hope of
reducing the impacts of the adelgid on the hemlock resource.
