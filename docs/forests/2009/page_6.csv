"Relatively little storm damage occurred compared to past years, although some surveyed locations registered"
small areas impacted by strong winds and hail. A hail storm in June defoliated almost 400 acres along Rt. 211

"of tornados in Campbell County in mid-July. Approximately 100 acres of oak, pine, and poplar were reported"
destroyed. Virginia was not impacted by any tropical systems in 2009.
