Yellow-Poplar Decline and the Poplar Weevil in Southwest Virginia,Yellow-Poplar Decline and the Poplar Weevil in Southwest Virginia,
continued,,
"decline or even death. Recently, some landowners",,
"across Lee, Wise and Scott counties have seen such",,
poplar decline over the last few years and have,,
"expressed concerns to local foresters. In most cases,",,
these areas of decline are small – generally from,,
1⁄2 acre to several acres in size – although several,,
locations have exhibited decline spanning 50 acres,,
to 100 acres.,,
There appears to be no obvious reason why these,,
"declines show up where they do, other than the fact",,
that these areas were known to have several weevil,,
outbreaks during past years. Because tree decline,,
is a gradual process that can take many years and,,
"be caused by multiple agents, it’s always difficult to",,
pinpoint exact causes. But knowing that the weevil,,
is a major presence in the region and one of the,,
"few insects that can feed on poplar, it seems very",,
possible that it is playing a prominent role in these,,
decline events. The good news is that the affected,,
"areas are quite small, and most of the poplar trees",,
were weakened but not dead. That means the wood,,
"is probably still sound and can be salvaged, so most",,
landowners can still profit from forests with some,Figure 4. The areas of yellow poplar decline coincide with the red,Figure 4. The areas of yellow poplar decline coincide with the red
