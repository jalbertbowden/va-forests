"Fall Cankerworm Outbreak, Again,",
continued,
"While the overall area of infestation in 2013 was similar to that in 2012,",
the areas of heaviest defoliation shifted somewhat between years. This is to,
be expected because severe cankerworm populations attract predators like,
"birds and ground beetles, while other insects parasitize cankerworm eggs and",
"larvae. Thus, areas that see heavy defoliation one year tend to be less severely",
"impacted the following year, and vice versa.",
While these boom and bust cycles are a hallmark of cankerworm population,
"dynamics, outbreaks tend to recur in the same areas over time since the adult",
female moths are wingless and flightless and don’t disperse very far from,
"where they fed as caterpillars. In fact, the City of Charlotte, North Carolina,",
has been dealing with recurring cankerworm populations for more than 20,
years and even has an organized spray program for the city and surrounding,
counties because the of the level of public nuisance generated by this pest.,
Will Richmond and surrounding counties experience the same fate? I do have,
my concerns that this will be a recurring issue for this heavily-populated area,
,of the state.

Yellow-Poplar Decline and the Poplar Weevil in Southwest Virginia,Yellow-Poplar Decline and the Poplar Weevil in Southwest Virginia,
continued,,
"decline or even death. Recently, some landowners",,
"across Lee, Wise and Scott counties have seen such",,
poplar decline over the last few years and have,,
"expressed concerns to local foresters. In most cases,",,
these areas of decline are small – generally from,,
1⁄2 acre to several acres in size – although several,,
locations have exhibited decline spanning 50 acres,,
to 100 acres.,,
There appears to be no obvious reason why these,,
"declines show up where they do, other than the fact",,
that these areas were known to have several weevil,,
outbreaks during past years. Because tree decline,,
is a gradual process that can take many years and,,
"be caused by multiple agents, it’s always difficult to",,
pinpoint exact causes. But knowing that the weevil,,
is a major presence in the region and one of the,,
"few insects that can feed on poplar, it seems very",,
possible that it is playing a prominent role in these,,
decline events. The good news is that the affected,,
"areas are quite small, and most of the poplar trees",,
were weakened but not dead. That means the wood,,
"is probably still sound and can be salvaged, so most",,
landowners can still profit from forests with some,Figure 4. The areas of yellow poplar decline coincide with the red,Figure 4. The areas of yellow poplar decline coincide with the red
