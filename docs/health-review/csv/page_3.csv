"Fall Cankerworm Outbreak, Again,",
continued,
"While the overall area of infestation in 2013 was similar to that in 2012,",
the areas of heaviest defoliation shifted somewhat between years. This is to,
be expected because severe cankerworm populations attract predators like,
"birds and ground beetles, while other insects parasitize cankerworm eggs and",
"larvae. Thus, areas that see heavy defoliation one year tend to be less severely",
"impacted the following year, and vice versa.",
While these boom and bust cycles are a hallmark of cankerworm population,
"dynamics, outbreaks tend to recur in the same areas over time since the adult",
female moths are wingless and flightless and don’t disperse very far from,
"where they fed as caterpillars. In fact, the City of Charlotte, North Carolina,",
has been dealing with recurring cankerworm populations for more than 20,
years and even has an organized spray program for the city and surrounding,
counties because the of the level of public nuisance generated by this pest.,
Will Richmond and surrounding counties experience the same fate? I do have,
my concerns that this will be a recurring issue for this heavily-populated area,
,of the state.
