Notes:,,,,,,
"1.  Only forest land is included.  For example, rangeland and rocky/barren areas on national forests are not included in area estimates.",,,,,,
2.  Alaska only includes the southeast coast and does not include the 111 million acres of Interior Alaska because the FIA program does not yet collect plot data there.,,,,,,
3.  Hawaii is not included because the FIA inventory was only recently implemented and field data are not yet available.,,,,,,
"4.  Total carbon includes the following pools:  Aboveground (live trees, saplings, and understory vegetation); Belowground (roots of live trees, saplings, and understory vegetation); Deadwood (standing dead trees and down woody material); Forest Floor (litter); and Soil Organic Carbon.",,,,,,
