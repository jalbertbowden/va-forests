Cover photo: A beautiful spring day in the Southeastern United States is
seen in this SeaWiFS image. Several smoke plumes are visible including
"a rather large one that originates in Georgia, midway between the"
Savannah and Altamaha rivers. A good-sized plume of turbid water can
also be seen flushing out of Mobile Bay. Photo courtesy of the SeaWiFS
