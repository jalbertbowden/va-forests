450,,,,,,,Demand
,,,,,,,■ Consumption of lumber in the
400,,,,,,,United States has grown at a lower
,,,,,,,"rate than housing starts, indicating"
350,,,,,,,some substitution away from lumber
,,,,,,,as a building material.
300,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,■ Both nonwood and engineered
250,,,,,,,wood products have substituted for
,,,,,,,lumber in many applications. For
200,,,,,,,"example, the share of floors, walls,"
,,,,,,,and roofs made with wood is about
150,,,,,,,constant but there is a shift toward
,,,,,,,greater use of engineered wood
100,,,,,,,products.
,,,,,,,■ Electronic media are substituting
50,,,,,,,for paper.
0,,,,,,,■ A majority of pulping capacity in
,,,,,,,the United States is located in the
1992,1994,1996,1998,2000,2002,2004,
,,,,,,,"South, but this share has declined"
