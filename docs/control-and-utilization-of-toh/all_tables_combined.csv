Below are comments from various craftsmen:
“It had excellent machining properties in the joiner and planer.
It tooled real well with the jigs used to make dovetail joints.”
“It behaved very much like white ash. If I had not been told it
"was Ailanthus, I would have guessed it to be white ash.”"
“The grade of the lumber is very important. Many of these
"boards looked pretty good, but there was still a lot of waste.”"
"“In storage, it warped and cupped extremely badly. It did not"
"check or split nearly as bad. I stored it in the upstairs shop,"
which is pretty hot during the summer. I stored much of the
"other hardwood I use their too, so it was a good comparison.”"
“It sanded very well.”
“It finished very well. Tung oil was used on the blanket chest
to accent the grain pattern. It appeared to take stain well on
a test piece.”
“It would be important to saw it at least 5/4. This is needed to
"be able to get the cup and warp out. Even with this thickness,"
I had to rip the boards and then glue them back together. I do
this with most wide boards of other species to reduce problems
with cupping.”
“I felt the wood had potential in furniture manufacture where
a good hardwood was needed for framing that would then be
covered with fabric.”
“I really look forward to using more of this wood. I hope to
"see it on the market soon, especially if it can be bought at"
a good price.”
