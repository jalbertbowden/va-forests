"pine on his family’s property near Yale. So, in 2002, he began with"
"a one-acre project, followed by 15 acres in 2005, 180 acres in"
2006 and 105 acres in 2009; Mr. Owen then planted another 100
acres of longleaf pine in Surry County. He has utilized many forest
"management tools to do this, including site preparation, release"
and several prescribed burns. He takes an active role in planning and
management on the property. Six agencies have cooperated with Mr. Owen.
Funding for the initial project was provided by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service. Virginia NRCS cost assistance and the VDOF SPB Prevention
Program have helped on the larger projects. DCR and DGIF have provided
"technical assistance as well. Finally, Mr. Owen has donated a conservation"
"easement to The Nature Conservancy on this 1,400 acres of family land and"
is in negotiations with TNC for an easement on an adjoining 450 acres. This
"is the core for TNC’s Raccoon Creek Pinelands Conservation Area. In 2013,"
Mr. Owen planted an additional 525 acres of longleaf pine – 400 acres with
NRCS funding and 125 acres with funding from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service and Norfolk Southern Foundation – making this by far the largest
concentration of longleaf in Virginia. Mr. Owen is a model landowner and

Forester William ‘Billy’ Apperson had a long working relationship with
the owners and custodian of the property. When it was time to harvest a
"loblolly pine stand on a sandy, level site near the river, Billy recommended"
"longleaf pine. Following harvest, the area was prepared and planted with"
longleaf in 1998 and subsequently burned several times. The Wright’s
