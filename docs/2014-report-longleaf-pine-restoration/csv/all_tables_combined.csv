Longleaf Restoration
Area Profiles
The following are brief profiles of several key longleaf restoration areas inVirginia:
Chub Sandhill Natural Area Preserve;
Antioch Pines Natural Area Preserve;
South Quay Sandhills Natural Area Preserve
Landowner: Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR)
Location:
"Sebrell, Sussex County; Zuni, Isle of Wight County; South Quay,City of Sufolk"
"Size/Desfcription: 5,226 acres total. Chub Sandhill (1,066 acres) and"
"Antioch Pines (1,017 acres) are situated on well-drained terraces along the"
"Nottoway River and Blackwater River, respectively. South Quay Sandhills"
"encompasses 3,143 acres along the Blackwater River and includes the"
state’s most extensive pine sandhills community. The properties are
managed with prescribed fire to provide suitable habitat for dozens of rareplant and anma speciges.
Longleaf Piine lAcreae/Description (as of March 2013): 357 acres
"total. 155 acres at Chub Sandhill (planted in 2007, 2008 and 2013); 202"
acres at Antioch Pines (planted in 2011 and 2012). South Quay Sandhills
contains the state’s largest remaining natural stands of longleaf pine with
a total of 75 acres of pine forests containing longleaf as a major overstory
component. Seed collected from South Quay by VDOF and DCR is used for
"propagation of native longleaf pine seedlings, most of which have beenplanted on state naturlal ariea preserve."
Restoration Goals:
"Al sutable sites son these three, plus two additionalstate natural area preserves representing more than 2,500 acres, will be"
converted to longleaf pine as existing loblolly stands are harvested and
northern-source seedlings are available. Only northern-source seedlings
are used to establish longleaf pine on Virginia state natural area preserves.

"a one-acre project, followed by 15 acres in 2005, 180 acres in"
2006 and 105 acres in 2009; Mr. Owen then planted another 100
acres of longleaf pine in Surry County. He has utilized many forest
"management tools to do this, including site preparation, release"
and several prescribed burns. He takes an active role in planning and
management on the property. Six agencies have cooperated with Mr. Owen.
Funding for the initial project was provided by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service. Virginia NRCS cost assistance and the VDOF SPB Prevention
Program have helped on the larger projects. DCR and DGIF have provided
"technical assistance as well. Finally, Mr. Owen has donated a conservation"
"easement to The Nature Conservancy on this 1,400 acres of family land and"
is in negotiations with TNC for an easement on an adjoining 450 acres. This
"is the core for TNC’s Raccoon Creek Pinelands Conservation Area. In 2013,"
Mr. Owen planted an additional 525 acres of longleaf pine – 400 acres with
NRCS funding and 125 acres with funding from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service and Norfolk Southern Foundation – making this by far the largest
concentration of longleaf in Virginia. Mr. Owen is a model landowner and

Northern Range Extension for Longleaf Pine
"The natural range of longleaf pine is in southeast Virginia,"
with very few remnant trees. There is speculation and
discussion regarding longleaf on the Eastern Shore or
north of the James River. There have been a number of
recent plantings in the northern Coastal Plain and as
far west as Halifax County in the Piedmont. There is
considerable scientific discussion about the northern
migration of southern species with changing climate.
How will longleaf pine grow and react farther north?
"To predict this, it may be helpful to look at examples"
of longleaf pine planted outside of its native range.
Citizens have been moving longleaf pine north for years.
Longleaf can be found in yards and homesteads
"in many areas in the Coastal Plain and Piedmont,"
including the Richmond and Fredericksburg areas.
Many of these open-grown trees show the effects
"of snow and ice damage and can be crooked. But,"

Perhaps the best and oldest example of longleaf
established outside of its native range is in
Albemarle County on the Virginia Department
of Forestry Headquarters Shop property in
Charlottesville (photos taken 2013). This western
Piedmont site (38.02357o N -78.53365o W) is
approximately 550 feet in elevation and about
80 miles northwest of the nearest point on the
"Eberhardt, et al. (2011) longleaf range map. It"
was originally used as a tree seedling nursery.
"Around the nursery beds, test plantings of a number of"
trees not native to the area were established. One block
included longleaf pine according to a map dated May
1934. Some of the original longleaf still survives in the
form of approximately 50 dominants ranging from 70 to
105 feet in height and about 16 to 30 inches in diameter
"at breast height (DBH). Despite some mortality, form is"
"good on many of the remaining trees, many averaging"
two to three merchantable logs. While the biggest trees
were too large to be cored with a standard increment
"borer, core samples from some smaller ones (under 22"
inches DBH) revealed an approximate age of 60 years.
It’s possible some of larger trees on the site date back to
"the original 1934 planting. Regardless of tree age, the"
success of this stand demonstrates that longleaf will
