Northern Range Extension for Longleaf Pine
"The natural range of longleaf pine is in southeast Virginia,"
with very few remnant trees. There is speculation and
discussion regarding longleaf on the Eastern Shore or
north of the James River. There have been a number of
recent plantings in the northern Coastal Plain and as
far west as Halifax County in the Piedmont. There is
considerable scientific discussion about the northern
migration of southern species with changing climate.
How will longleaf pine grow and react farther north?
"To predict this, it may be helpful to look at examples"
of longleaf pine planted outside of its native range.
Citizens have been moving longleaf pine north for years.
Longleaf can be found in yards and homesteads
"in many areas in the Coastal Plain and Piedmont,"
including the Richmond and Fredericksburg areas.
Many of these open-grown trees show the effects
"of snow and ice damage and can be crooked. But,"

Perhaps the best and oldest example of longleaf
established outside of its native range is in
Albemarle County on the Virginia Department
of Forestry Headquarters Shop property in
Charlottesville (photos taken 2013). This western
Piedmont site (38.02357o N -78.53365o W) is
approximately 550 feet in elevation and about
80 miles northwest of the nearest point on the
"Eberhardt, et al. (2011) longleaf range map. It"
was originally used as a tree seedling nursery.
"Around the nursery beds, test plantings of a number of"
trees not native to the area were established. One block
included longleaf pine according to a map dated May
1934. Some of the original longleaf still survives in the
form of approximately 50 dominants ranging from 70 to
105 feet in height and about 16 to 30 inches in diameter
"at breast height (DBH). Despite some mortality, form is"
"good on many of the remaining trees, many averaging"
two to three merchantable logs. While the biggest trees
were too large to be cored with a standard increment
"borer, core samples from some smaller ones (under 22"
inches DBH) revealed an approximate age of 60 years.
It’s possible some of larger trees on the site date back to
"the original 1934 planting. Regardless of tree age, the"
success of this stand demonstrates that longleaf will
