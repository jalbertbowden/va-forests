Longleaf Restoration
Area Profiles
The following are brief profiles of several key longleaf restoration areas inVirginia:
Chub Sandhill Natural Area Preserve;
Antioch Pines Natural Area Preserve;
South Quay Sandhills Natural Area Preserve
Landowner: Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR)
Location:
"Sebrell, Sussex County; Zuni, Isle of Wight County; South Quay,City of Sufolk"
"Size/Desfcription: 5,226 acres total. Chub Sandhill (1,066 acres) and"
"Antioch Pines (1,017 acres) are situated on well-drained terraces along the"
"Nottoway River and Blackwater River, respectively. South Quay Sandhills"
"encompasses 3,143 acres along the Blackwater River and includes the"
state’s most extensive pine sandhills community. The properties are
managed with prescribed fire to provide suitable habitat for dozens of rareplant and anma speciges.
Longleaf Piine lAcreae/Description (as of March 2013): 357 acres
"total. 155 acres at Chub Sandhill (planted in 2007, 2008 and 2013); 202"
acres at Antioch Pines (planted in 2011 and 2012). South Quay Sandhills
contains the state’s largest remaining natural stands of longleaf pine with
a total of 75 acres of pine forests containing longleaf as a major overstory
component. Seed collected from South Quay by VDOF and DCR is used for
"propagation of native longleaf pine seedlings, most of which have beenplanted on state naturlal ariea preserve."
Restoration Goals:
"Al sutable sites son these three, plus two additionalstate natural area preserves representing more than 2,500 acres, will be"
converted to longleaf pine as existing loblolly stands are harvested and
northern-source seedlings are available. Only northern-source seedlings
are used to establish longleaf pine on Virginia state natural area preserves.
