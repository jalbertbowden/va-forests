Forestland can provide countless hours of recreation-,timber theft is a severe problem which could affect
al benefits as well as an important source of income.,their landholdings.
Many landowners take careful steps to ensure that their,
property is managed to maximize the benefits they re-,

cated by one of Virginia’s most dreaded forest pests:,Virginia timber types range from the mixed hardwood
timber thieves.,stands of the Appalachian Mountains to the pure pine
,"stands of the Coastal Plain, with a tremendous amount"
"Thanks to high timber prices, timber theft is an attrac-","of diversity in-between. As a result, the type of theft"
"tive crime. It is not only highly profitable for thieves,",may differ depending on what timber is targeted. High-

"efforts to stop thieves have been so unsuccessful, there",gle log. If savvy thieves see a tree which can bring this
has been very little publicity about the crime itself. As,"much profit standing alone beside a rural woods road,"
"a result, many private landowners do not realize that",there is little to deter them from felling the tree and
,loading a log or two onto a truck. A quick trip to the
,local sawmill can instantly provide ample income with
,minimal risk. In pine stands and lower-value hardwood
,"stands, significant profit requires a little more time and"
,"effort. Here, multiple acres of timber may need to be"
,harvested before the thieves have enough money in
,their pockets to justify the risk.
,"Either of these thefts, though, can easily ruin the value"
,of a timber stand and quickly undermine any manage-
,ment plans which may have been prepared.
,Legal Recourse
,There are two legal approaches to dealing with timber
,theft: criminal and civil. Thanks to recent legislation
,"in Virginia, pursuing these legal remedies has become"
,somewhat easier for landowners.
,Criminal Remedies
,While the act of stealing another’s property typically
,"constitutes larceny, in timber theft cases, where it is"
,likely that the value of the stolen property is greater
