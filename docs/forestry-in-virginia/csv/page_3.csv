Why Do We Cut Down Trees?
"Trees may be cut down, or harvested, for many reasons. These include"
"keeping a forest healthy, improving wildlife habitat, making products and"
providing income.
"Cutting some of the trees in a forest gives the others more nutrients,"
"sunlight, water and space to grow. Sometimes all of the trees are cut at"
"once, to start a new forest of trees that cannot grow in shade, such as"
pines. Trees that have diseases or harmful insects may be cut to keep
other trees from getting sick.
"Harvesting trees can make the habitat better for some animals, such"
"as deer, turkeys, rabbits, foxes and many songbirds and insects. When"
"trees are taken away, more sunlight reaches the ground. This promotes"
"the growth of grasses, soft plants and shrubs that produce wildlife food"
and shelter.
Trees are also harvested to make products we use every day. These
"include lumber for building; paper for reading and writing, and more"
"than 5,000 other products. You can find tree products in odd places:"
"toothpaste, ice cream, chewing gum, molded plastics, packaging and"
"soap, to name a few! Selling trees for forest products can help people"
"earn a living. Because trees have monetary value, people look at them"
as an investment for the future. This may encourage them to plant
"more trees, so there will always be a new supply growing."
