What are “working
Forests” and
why do we
need them?
"Forests are full of trees, which"
"are good for people, animals"
and the entire environment.
A working forest is one that
is actively managed and usually
gives its owner income at some time. Working forests not only
"supply products like paper and lumber, but also clean our air and"
"water, protect the soil, produce oxygen, provide shade, create"
"wildlife habitat, offer beautiful scenery and give us space for"
recreation.
What Does a
Forester Do?
A forester’s job is to work with trees. Most
foresters have jobs that allow them to spend
some time outdoors and some time indoors.
Tasks may include meeting with landowners to
help them make decisions about caring for their
forest; writing management plans; making maps;
coordinating tree planting; fighting forest fires;
visiting areas where trees are being cut to make
sure good practices are being used; checking
for diseases and insects that can harm trees;
"answering questions from the public, and making"
presentations to groups. Foresters who work for
"the government may do all of these things, and"
"more, over the course of several weeks! Foresters"
who work in private business may specialize in
particular forestry tasks.
