What can I do,,
to help save,,
our forests?,,
If your family or friends own forested,,
"land, encourage them to keep it and",,

environment and the community.,,

help forests by buying wood products,,
from Virginia and elsewhere in the,,
United States. When people buy wood,,
"products, forest owners can make money",,
from their trees. This makes it more likely,,
"that they will keep growing trees on their land,",,
rather than changing it to other land uses. Wood,,
is a renewable resource for building. It requires,,
much less energy to process than nonrenewable,,
materials like steel and concrete. Wood products,,Illustrations by
