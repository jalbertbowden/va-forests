What are “working
Forests” and
why do we
need them?
"Forests are full of trees, which"
"are good for people, animals"
and the entire environment.
A working forest is one that
is actively managed and usually
gives its owner income at some time. Working forests not only
"supply products like paper and lumber, but also clean our air and"
"water, protect the soil, produce oxygen, provide shade, create"
"wildlife habitat, offer beautiful scenery and give us space for"
recreation.
What Does a
Forester Do?
A forester’s job is to work with trees. Most
foresters have jobs that allow them to spend
some time outdoors and some time indoors.
Tasks may include meeting with landowners to
help them make decisions about caring for their
forest; writing management plans; making maps;
coordinating tree planting; fighting forest fires;
visiting areas where trees are being cut to make
sure good practices are being used; checking
for diseases and insects that can harm trees;
"answering questions from the public, and making"
presentations to groups. Foresters who work for
"the government may do all of these things, and"
"more, over the course of several weeks! Foresters"
who work in private business may specialize in
particular forestry tasks.

Why Do We Cut Down Trees?
"Trees may be cut down, or harvested, for many reasons. These include"
"keeping a forest healthy, improving wildlife habitat, making products and"
providing income.
"Cutting some of the trees in a forest gives the others more nutrients,"
"sunlight, water and space to grow. Sometimes all of the trees are cut at"
"once, to start a new forest of trees that cannot grow in shade, such as"
pines. Trees that have diseases or harmful insects may be cut to keep
other trees from getting sick.
"Harvesting trees can make the habitat better for some animals, such"
"as deer, turkeys, rabbits, foxes and many songbirds and insects. When"
"trees are taken away, more sunlight reaches the ground. This promotes"
"the growth of grasses, soft plants and shrubs that produce wildlife food"
and shelter.
Trees are also harvested to make products we use every day. These
"include lumber for building; paper for reading and writing, and more"
"than 5,000 other products. You can find tree products in odd places:"
"toothpaste, ice cream, chewing gum, molded plastics, packaging and"
"soap, to name a few! Selling trees for forest products can help people"
"earn a living. Because trees have monetary value, people look at them"
as an investment for the future. This may encourage them to plant
"more trees, so there will always be a new supply growing."

What can I do,,
to help save,,
our forests?,,
If your family or friends own forested,,
"land, encourage them to keep it and",,
manage it. A well-managed forest can,,
benefit the owners as well as the,,
environment and the community.,,
"It may sound strange, but you can",,
help forests by buying wood products,,
from Virginia and elsewhere in the,,
United States. When people buy wood,,
"products, forest owners can make money",,
from their trees. This makes it more likely,,
"that they will keep growing trees on their land,",,
rather than changing it to other land uses. Wood,,
is a renewable resource for building. It requires,,
much less energy to process than nonrenewable,,
materials like steel and concrete. Wood products,,Illustrations by
