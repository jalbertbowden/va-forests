"this past March, I would have to agree! Signs of this decline",
"are literally everywhere, not always dramatic or even obvious",
"if you’re not looking for it, but if you are, it’s there – a dead",
branch here; a dead sapling there; a clump of dead mature,
trees over yonder. If one assumes that these early signs will,
"lead to more decline and mortality, then there are going to",
be a lot more dead white pines in the near future. Other,
locations that I had been to in the past where there may have,
"been one or a few dead trees now have many. In particular,",
a white pine plantation in the middle of the small village,
of Bacova in Bath County has deteriorated significantly. Two,
"years ago, there were only a few signs of the condition on the",
"edge of the stand. Now, it looks as though 10 to 15 percent",
of the trees within the stand are dead. Although white pine,
is typically grown in an overstocked condition and gradual,
decline in mature stands is not unheard of – the seemingly,Dead branches on these white pines in Bath County

myself echoing John Wright’s fears that it could get a lot,
worse and possibly become quite dramatic. More and more,
calls are coming to him from concerned landowners. It’s,
time I brought this to more people’s attention so that I can,
get others involved in solving this mystery. I have already,
contacted some entomologists and pathologists from Virginia,
Tech and invited them to take a closer look. Even if we figure,
"it out, I’m not sure what can be done other than replace",
white pine with other species (Norway spruce?) – but a big,
concern is that any sudden loss of all the natural white pine,
