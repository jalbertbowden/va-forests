Control of Tree-of-Heaven
"by Amy Snyder, Department of Entomology, Virginia Tech"
Tree-of-heaven (Ailanthus altissima) is a widespread invasive weed found throughout much of the
continental United States. The species was imported as a shade tree indirectly from Europe in the
"late 18 th century and, later, directly from its native habitat in China. This tree is widely known for"
"its ability to withstand environmental pollutants, poor soils and water stress, but nearly every part"
"of this tree produces a strong, unpleasant odor. Tree-of-heaven (TOH) is a serious threat to native"
ecosystems because it is a strong competitor and produces allelopathic chemicals that inhibit the
"growth of native hardwood and coniferous trees. In addition, few herbivores significantly impact its"
health and reproduction.
"TOH is a fast-growing, prolific tree reaching heights of up to 27 meters in its 75- to 80-year life"
"span. Mature TOH can produce up to 300,000 samara seeds per year, which are ideally shaped"
"for wind dispersal. TOH also spreads vigorously through asexual sprouting from roots and stumps,"
"often resulting in dense thicket growth. TOH produces weak, lightweight wood making it unsuitable"
for timber and prone to breaking from heavy winds or snow accumulation. TOH can often be seen
"growing along roadsides, newly harvested forest areas, agricultural land and other disrupted habitats."
"In Virginia, it is dominant along I-81 and Route 29 and is widely distributed even in protected areas,"
such as Shenandoah National Park. Many natural resource professionals and landowners rate TOH
"as the worst forest weed in Virginia. While herbicides can be used to kill TOH, this is not practical"
on a large scale. These are some of the reasons why finding a biological control agent
"for TOH is a priority, and a fungus with the scientific name Verticillium"
albo-atrum seems to have the most potential for this.
