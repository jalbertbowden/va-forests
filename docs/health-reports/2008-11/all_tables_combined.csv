,,,,,,,New Tree-of-Heaven
,,,,,,,Publication Coming
,,,,,,,Soon
,,,,,,,Tree-of-Heaven (Ailanthus altissima) is probably the
,,,,,,,most significant forest weed in Virginia and is the bane
,,,,,,,of many a landowner. Department of Forestry personnel
,,,,,,,are often asked what the most efficient means of control
,,,,,,,is for this prevalent weed. We will soon release a new
,,,,,,,"publication on Ailanthus, which emphasizes optimal"
,,,,,,,control strategies and means of utilization. The idea
,,,,,,,is to find possible uses for all size and age classes of
,,,,,,,"Ailanthus, which could serve to balance control costs."
,,,,,,,Reducing net costs would increase the incentive for
,,,,,,,some landowners to control and or eliminate it from
,,,,,,,their property. This publication will be based on recent
,,,,,,,"work by myself; Jerre Creighton; Charlie Becker, and"
,,,,,,,Virginia Tech’s Wood Products and Pallet Testing labs.
,,,,,,,"Other future uses are also being considered, including"
,,,,,,,small-diameter harvests of Ailanthus for pulpwood or
,,,,,,,biomass production.
