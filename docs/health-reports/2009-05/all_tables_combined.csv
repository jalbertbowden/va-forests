Japanese Honeysuckle,
"Japanese honeysuckle, Lonicera japonica, is considered to be the",
most common non-native invasive (NNI) plant in the forests of,
the southeastern U.S. and is found in 38 states. Like many NNI,
"weeds, it comes from eastern Asia and was introduced into the",
"U.S. via Long Island, New York, in 1806. It was planted primarily",
"for erosion control, as an ornamental due to its attractive flowers,",
"and for deer forage. It is prolific along forest edges, openings",
and disturbed habitats; it can also invade interior forest due to,
"moderate shade tolerance, although it is not as shade tolerant as",
"some native vines, and it rarely produces flowers in low light.",
"While it is commonly found trailing along the ground, it is most",
"noticeable when it climbs its way up a tree, power line or other",
scaffolding to heights of up to 80 feet. It is capable of girdling,
"shrubs and saplings by twining around them, as well as overtopping",
and shading larger trees and shrubs by forming dense mats.,
Dense thickets of honeysuckle on the forest floor can also inhibit,
the growth of native understory plants and tree seedlings. Root,
"competition can be most severe, lowering overall leaf nitrogen,",
photosynthesis and growth of native plants. Forest regeneration,
following a disturbance can be difficult or nearly non-existent in,
honeysuckle infested areas. Due to its evergreen to semi-evergreen,
"status, Japanese honeysuckle experiences a long growing season,",
allowing it to be highly competitive with native plants for resources,
above and below ground. When invading and establishing along,
"forest edges or openings, honeysuckle can form an imposing wall",
"of vegetation. In addition to its moderate shade tolerance, it is also",
"tolerant of flooding and drought, allowing it to thrive in a variety",
of habitats. It has also shown a positive response to an increase,
in carbon dixoxide (CO2).,
Honeysuckle flowers appear in late summer to early fall and are,
pollinated by insects and hummingbirds. Fruits appear in September,
"to October. Beyond rapid vegetative growth, honeysuckle fruit and",
"seed is consumed and spread by deer, rabbits, bobwhite quail,",
"turkey and other birds. Seed production is prolific, but seed bank",
potential is very low (less than one year). Germination is promoted,
"by high light and disturbed, exposed soil. It sprouts vigorously",
"after cutting or fire, and following a controlled burn honeysuckle",
"is known to return to pre-burn levels within a few years. Typically,",
honeysuckle will remain at low densities in mature forest until,
"released by thinning or a clear-cut, at which point it spreads rapidly.",
Early successional forests with small-diameter trees can quickly,
become overrun with honeysuckle to the point of stand failure.,
Hand pulling and cutting can be effective for small,
patches. Cutting climbing vines at the base,“Scientists do not discover in
is an efficient way to quickly kill a lot,"order to know, they know in"
,order to discover.”
,"Edward O. Wilson, 1984"
