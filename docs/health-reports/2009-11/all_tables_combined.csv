"After four years of drought, we finally got a break this spring,",,,,,,
"continuing into early summer. Between April and June, there",,,,,,
were more rainy days than I can remember. Entire weeks went,,,,,,
"by without sun, and I could not have been happier. For the",,,,,,
"last four years, gypsy moth populations have been on the rise,",,,,,,
but that trend finally ended. A particularly wet May continuing,,,,,,
"into June meant that the gypsy moth fungus, Entomophaga",,,,,,
"maimaiga, was able to thrive during the larval feeding period.",,,,,,
It virtually wiped out gypsy moth populations in many locations,,,,,,
"across the state, as you’ll see in the ‘Updates’ section.",,,,,,
More of our foresters are starting to use their Trimble units to,,,,,,
"enter forest health ground observations in IFRIS, allowing for",,,,,,
