Emerald Ash Borer Rears Its Ugly,Emerald Ash Borer Rears Its Ugly
Green Head In Maryland,Green Head In Maryland
The emerald ash borer (EAB) is right on our doorstep. In,
"Prince George’s County, Maryland, just south of the DC",
"area and north of Waldorf, the Maryland Department of",
Agriculture (MDA) has undertaken an enormous effort,
to eradicate the beetle. This is the second eradication,
attempt; the first one occurred three years ago and,
was seemingly successful until the beetle was spotted,
again during August 2006. The rediscovery occurred,
"very close to the original eradication zone and, in",
"some locations, the infestation appeared to be at least",
a couple of years old. This suggests that the original,
eradication was not completely successful.,
"This past winter, MDA personnel, along with a slew of",
"volunteers from other states, have scoured an area of",
approximately 25 square miles surrounding the original,
,"An unusually heavy concentration of ash trees near Waldorf,"
eradication zone. The intent was to locate and record,"MD, most of which have evidence of current or previous"
"all ash trees within that zone, and remove and destroy",infestation by the emerald ash borer.
any infested ash trees before the emerald ash borer,
adults begin to emerge from infested trees in April. I,
had an opportunity to participate in this effort for a day,
and was impressed with the enormity of the task. There,
were volunteers from state forestry departments from,
"Delaware, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and",
"New York, among others. Some of these volunteers",
were present for a week or more. All of the participants,
met daily at the MDA Warehouse off Route 301 to,
gather equipment and be placed into work crews. Each,
"crew, usually about 10 to 15 people led by an MDA",
"official, was then sent to a particular location to begin",
systematically surveying a series of adjacent 21⁄2-acre,
grids. Every ash tree encountered was entered into a,
GPS. The number of ash trees found in a grid varied,
"from none to many, and the environment varied from",
highly residential/urban to heavily wooded. There were,
thousands of grids to be completed and hundreds of,All infested ash are brought to this marshaling yard run by
ash trees to be removed. The logistical complications,the Maryland Department of Agriculture and destroyed in a
