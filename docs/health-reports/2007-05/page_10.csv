The emerald ash borer (EAB) is right on our doorstep. In,
"Prince George’s County, Maryland, just south of the DC",
"area and north of Waldorf, the Maryland Department of",
Agriculture (MDA) has undertaken an enormous effort,
to eradicate the beetle. This is the second eradication,
attempt; the first one occurred three years ago and,
was seemingly successful until the beetle was spotted,
again during August 2006. The rediscovery occurred,
"very close to the original eradication zone and, in",
"some locations, the infestation appeared to be at least",
a couple of years old. This suggests that the original,
eradication was not completely successful.,
"This past winter, MDA personnel, along with a slew of",
"volunteers from other states, have scoured an area of",
approximately 25 square miles surrounding the original,

and was impressed with the enormity of the task. There,
were volunteers from state forestry departments from,

were present for a week or more. All of the participants,
met daily at the MDA Warehouse off Route 301 to,
gather equipment and be placed into work crews. Each,

systematically surveying a series of adjacent 21⁄2-acre,
grids. Every ash tree encountered was entered into a,

"from none to many, and the environment varied from",
