Continued from page 10,and the multiple stresses from years of drought and
,"storm damage in past issues. Thus, it is clear that"
,there are many highly stressed and dying trees in
,"the landscape, and this VOLC outbreak will not help."
,Some foresters have also reported that many trees
,have leafed out partially by the end of the summer.
,"This will actually weaken trees further, as they are"
,using important energy reserves to replace the lost
,"leaves, lessening their winter hardiness. Hopefully"
,most trees will fare well.

"for Hanover and Henrico counties, search for VOLC pre-pupae",
and their ground beetle predators under a defoliated stand in,
"Hanover County, Virginia.",
What will be the impact of all of this defoliation?,
"In general, healthy hardwood trees can withstand",
"a significant amount of defoliation, even complete",
"defoliation, without being killed or even significantly",
weakened. An event like this that occurs for only,
one year can actually benefit the forest by returning,Frass piles up on the forest floor as VOLC munch on the leaves
"nutrients to the soil in the form of insect frass, which",above.
"acts as a fertilizer. On the other hand, trees that aren’t",
healthy may suffer or even be pushed past the point of,
no return from this event. I have already,
