Greetings,,
This is the first issue of the Forest Health Review since the retirement of,,
"Tim Tigner, my illustrious predecessor. I will do my best to continue this",,
publication twice a year and carry on with reporting the most up to date,,
forest health information for the Commonwealth. While my style may,,
"differ slightly from Tim’s, the basic format will be much the same.",,
"For those of you I have not yet had the pleasure of meeting, I look",,
forward to working with you in the future. I’m sure it won’t be long,,
before some pest problem brings me your way. I have been working,,
"hard to maintain the standard of excellence Tim has set, although his",,
30 years of experience will obviously be difficult to replace in the short,,
"term. I am also new to Virginia, so please bear with me as I learn my",,
way around and familiarize myself with the forest health issues that are,,
"most relevant to all of you. As always, I hope you find the Review to be",,
useful and informative.,,
