Greetings
There is so much going on in the forest health world this year that my head
"is already spinning, and spring has just ended. As you all know, things"
got going a little early this year with the record warm March experienced
"across much of the country. By my estimation, leaf emergence and insect"
"activity were about three weeks earlier than average, give or take. This"
early activity will be a recurring theme as you read through this issue.
While a second year of widespread (and very early) cankerworm activity
"occurred across much of suburban Richmond, the real story for me was"
our first discovery this spring of widespread emerald ash borer destruction
"in a heavily forested, non-urban setting in northern Frederick County. It"
"was only a matter of time for us, but was nonetheless very sobering to see"
after reading and hearing about devastation in other states like Michigan
"and Ohio. Read more details about this in the feature article. Speaking of sobering, federal funding has declined"
significantly this year and looks to continue the trend in upcoming years. It’s hard to know if this is just a temporary
"downward dip or the new normal, but for the short term, we’ll probably have to get used to it and make do the best we"
can by pooling resources as much as possible. The reality may be that certain programs and services in the forest health
"arena could be reduced or disappear altogether. However, our primary mission, in my view, is to keep you informed"
"and up to date, and we will continue to do that. I hope you enjoy this issue of the Forest Health Review."

Emerald Ash Borer in Action
in Northern Virginia
If you take route 522 northwest from Winchester in Frederick County and come within a few miles
"of the West Virginia state line, almost in the shadow of Cacapon Mountain to the West, you will"
have arrived at the first known forested area within Virginia that is experiencing widespread ash
mortality due to the emerald ash borer (EAB). While ash typically makes up about two percent of the
"forest by volume in northern Virginia (based on USDA Forest Service FIA inventory data), it seems"
to be quite a bit more abundant than that in this area. While we’ve known since 2010 that EAB
"was present in this county based on past trapping efforts by APHIS, there had never been any EAB-"
infested trees identified in the area until this spring. This provides further evidence that detecting
"emerald ash borer populations early in the invasion process is exceedingly difficult, especially in"
"a heavily-forested area, even when trapping EAB adults serves as an indication that they are in the"
vicinity.
"I was first made aware of this situation in March when I was contacted by Laura Shifflet, an employee of"
Frederick and Clarke counties who had been the gypsy moth coordinator in this area for many years.
Laura discovered the EAB infestations following inquiries from a few landowners regarding dying
ash trees on their respective properties. Subsequent surveys by Laura and Virginia Cooperative
Extension Agent Mark Sutphin revealed that the infestation spanned an area roughly
"6,000 acres to 7,000 acres in size (Figure 1). Given the size of this"
"area and the difficulty of early detection, it is easy"

,,to speculate that yet-to-be-discovered EAB populations are
,,killing ash trees in other locations within Virginia right now.
,,"I visited this location on April 4th, and upon walking up to the"
,,"edge of one of these forested stands, the first thing I noticed"
,,was that the infested ash trees were extremely easy to pick
,,out even though leaf emergence had not yet occurred. The
,,reason for this was an unusual but very noticeable pattern
,,"on the bark surface, best described as “flaking” – where"
,,"the outer, grayish bark sloughed off somehow to reveal a"
,,"lighter colored, tan inner bark underneath (Figures 2 and 3)."
,,Sometimes this flaking was apparent only in small patches
,,"on the bole of the tree, and in other instances, it was obvious"
,,"along the entire bole, in which case, the tree really stood out."
,,I have never observed anything quite like this on any species
,,"of tree before, let alone ash. So naturally, my first question"
,,was “what is causing this?”

"One thing we knew for sure, bark flaking was apparent only",the aid of a hatchet or draw knife. Working with short bolts
"on ash trees, and all the ash trees that had it were infested",of ash where you can more easily strip off bark from the edge
to one degree or another with emerald ash borer for some,made a huge difference. This was a real learning experience
time – my educated guess is that these trees had been under,in many ways. Since the inner bark and outer sapwood
attack for at least five years – but that is difficult to know for,"seemed riddled with EAB galleries (Figure 5), my first thought"
certain. We at least know that populations were present for,was that it would be relatively easy to recover specimens by
three years given that adults were trapped in 2010 and likely,pulling off the bark – but initially this was not the case. Over
emerged from nearby trees after a year of development.,"time, it became clear that most of the larvae and pupae were"
"Could the flaked bark have been from woodpeckers, as","in the middle of the thick bark, which seems to naturally"
some of us first speculated? Pileated woodpeckers often,divide along a seam that separates inner and outer bark. The
"create large, splintery holes in trees during their search for",best way to recover live specimens seems to be to tear the
"meals, and there was certainly evidence of their past activity","bark off in sheets and begin breaking it into smaller pieces,"
"around, but on that particular day, we did not hear or see",which often exposes larvae or pupae embedded between the
any woodpeckers. Nor could we explain why woodpeckers,"bark layers. After this realization, recovery of specimens was"
would flake off the outer bark in such a way that a flat surface,easier.
was left behind – as if someone had planed the tree or sliced,
the outer bark off with a drawknife – something I have never,
observed anywhere else where woodpeckers were abundant.,
"It seemed a stretch, but I didn’t have a better explanation.",
Fortunately some of the infested trees were cut into short,
"bolts and piled nearby, where we were able to remove bark",
"more easily, find EAB galleries and recover specimens of",
"EAB larvae and pupae (Figure 4). Unlike pine trees, where",
"bark peels off relatively easily after the tree is dead, ash bark",
remains tight on the tree and is difficult to remove even with,
,Figure 5. Wood and bark samples exhibiting extensive
,emerald ash borer galleries.
,"Because EAB larvae reside between inner and outer bark,"
,could the flaking off of the outer bark simply be a physical
,process that occurs when large numbers of EAB feed and
,reside within? This phenomenon has been observed in other
,"states where EAB populations are high, so perhaps the exact"
,mechanism of how and why this occurs will be studied in
,"the future. In the mean time, it provides a very convenient"

the flaked bark on most of the cut bolts.,We visited a second site nearby where many ash trees had
,"been worked over by EAB in a similar fashion, with bark"
,"flaking widely evident. On one large tree in particular,"
,we were able to peel off a lot of bark and collect many
,specimens. Barely a square inch of outer sapwood was found
