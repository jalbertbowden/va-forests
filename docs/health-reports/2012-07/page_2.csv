Greetings
There is so much going on in the forest health world this year that my head
"is already spinning, and spring has just ended. As you all know, things"
got going a little early this year with the record warm March experienced
"across much of the country. By my estimation, leaf emergence and insect"
"activity were about three weeks earlier than average, give or take. This"
early activity will be a recurring theme as you read through this issue.
While a second year of widespread (and very early) cankerworm activity
"occurred across much of suburban Richmond, the real story for me was"
our first discovery this spring of widespread emerald ash borer destruction
"in a heavily forested, non-urban setting in northern Frederick County. It"
"was only a matter of time for us, but was nonetheless very sobering to see"
after reading and hearing about devastation in other states like Michigan
"and Ohio. Read more details about this in the feature article. Speaking of sobering, federal funding has declined"
significantly this year and looks to continue the trend in upcoming years. It’s hard to know if this is just a temporary
"downward dip or the new normal, but for the short term, we’ll probably have to get used to it and make do the best we"
can by pooling resources as much as possible. The reality may be that certain programs and services in the forest health
"arena could be reduced or disappear altogether. However, our primary mission, in my view, is to keep you informed"
"and up to date, and we will continue to do that. I hope you enjoy this issue of the Forest Health Review."

Emerald Ash Borer in Action
in Northern Virginia
If you take route 522 northwest from Winchester in Frederick County and come within a few miles
"of the West Virginia state line, almost in the shadow of Cacapon Mountain to the West, you will"
have arrived at the first known forested area within Virginia that is experiencing widespread ash
mortality due to the emerald ash borer (EAB). While ash typically makes up about two percent of the
"forest by volume in northern Virginia (based on USDA Forest Service FIA inventory data), it seems"
to be quite a bit more abundant than that in this area. While we’ve known since 2010 that EAB
"was present in this county based on past trapping efforts by APHIS, there had never been any EAB-"
infested trees identified in the area until this spring. This provides further evidence that detecting
"emerald ash borer populations early in the invasion process is exceedingly difficult, especially in"
"a heavily-forested area, even when trapping EAB adults serves as an indication that they are in the"
vicinity.
"I was first made aware of this situation in March when I was contacted by Laura Shifflet, an employee of"
Frederick and Clarke counties who had been the gypsy moth coordinator in this area for many years.
Laura discovered the EAB infestations following inquiries from a few landowners regarding dying
ash trees on their respective properties. Subsequent surveys by Laura and Virginia Cooperative
Extension Agent Mark Sutphin revealed that the infestation spanned an area roughly
"6,000 acres to 7,000 acres in size (Figure 1). Given the size of this"
"area and the difficulty of early detection, it is easy"
