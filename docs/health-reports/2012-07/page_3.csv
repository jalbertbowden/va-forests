,,to speculate that yet-to-be-discovered EAB populations are
,,killing ash trees in other locations within Virginia right now.
,,"I visited this location on April 4th, and upon walking up to the"
,,"edge of one of these forested stands, the first thing I noticed"
,,was that the infested ash trees were extremely easy to pick
,,out even though leaf emergence had not yet occurred. The
,,reason for this was an unusual but very noticeable pattern
,,"on the bark surface, best described as “flaking” – where"
,,"the outer, grayish bark sloughed off somehow to reveal a"
,,"lighter colored, tan inner bark underneath (Figures 2 and 3)."
,,Sometimes this flaking was apparent only in small patches
,,"on the bole of the tree, and in other instances, it was obvious"
,,"along the entire bole, in which case, the tree really stood out."
,,I have never observed anything quite like this on any species
,,"of tree before, let alone ash. So naturally, my first question"
,,was “what is causing this?”
