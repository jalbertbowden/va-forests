Watershed Score for Step 3: 12 out of 30,,
Watershed Rank: 330 of 540,,
"The nearly 1,400-square-mile James River watershed",,
in southwestern Missouri is on the Ozark plateau and,,
"contains the city of Springfield, MO. Land use is roughly",,
"split between forest (31%), agricultural cover (grazing",,
"land, 37%), and other land uses. Riparian buffers are",,
about 50 percent forested with over one-third containing,,
agricultural land. The watershed is characterized by,,
grazing lands and residential development dominated,,
by large lots of 5 – 10 acres.,,
Approximately 80 percent of Springfield’s drinking water,,
"comes from surface waters (lakes, rivers) and the rest",,
"from ground water (wells, springs). The Blackman Water",,

The Blackman Water Treatment Plant provides about,watershed.,
18 million gallons per day (MGD) of treated water to its,,
customers with per unit chemical treatment costs of,,
$62.20/MGD. Although water supply reservoirs have,,
"improved dramatically since the 1930s, plant operators",,
have reported a decline in untreated water quality in,,
recent years attributed to eutrophication from increased,,
"turbidity in the James River, sedimentation of reservoirs,",,
and increased development of the source watershed.,,
Failing septic systems are also seen as one of the top,,
issues in the watershed.,,
County planning and zoning laws have been improved,,
to address better watershed protection. The Watershed,,
"Committee of the Ozarks, a nonprofit that has been",,
"partnering with local stakeholders, is working to protect",,
some property in the source watershed and to educate,,
the public.,,
