Data Source: Ability to Produce Clean Water (APCW)
Index by 30-m pixels
Description: See previous step.
GIS Process
"1. Using the “zonal statistics as table” function in ArcInfo,"
the average APCW score was computed for each
watershed.
2. The average scores were split into 10 quantiles and
"reclassified with a value of 1 – 10, with 1 being the"
lowest APCW and 10 the highest (See Table B-2.)
Result: See following map.
