Step 4 composite score: Development pressure on,
private forests in watersheds important for drinking,
water supply,
"Values for the two attributes in step 4 were summed,","where,"
resulting in a potential composite score of 4 to 40 for each,Step 3 = Importance of watersheds and private forest for
watershed.,drinking water supply
STEP 3 + DP = STEP 4,DP = Development Pressure per unit area
,Result: See following map.
