Appendix B
Ability to produce clean water (APCW) index
by 30-m pixels
"The six attributes in step 1 were summed, resulting in a"
value of 6 – 24 for each 30-m grid cell.
F + A + R + D + S + H = APCW
"where,"
F = forest land (percent)
A = agricultural land (percent)
R = riparian forest cover (percent)
D = road density (quartiles)
S = soil erodibility (k factor)
H = housing density (acres per housing unit in 2000)
