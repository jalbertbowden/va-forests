Map 2: Private and protected forest land. Most forests in the Northeast and Midwest United States are
privately owned.......................................................................................................................................................................................................... 5
"Map 3: Change in housing density, 2000 - 2030. Housing density in the study area is"
projected to increase from 2000 to 2030........................................................................................................................................................... 5
"Map 4: Surface water consumers. Most surface drinking water supply systems in the Northeast are small,"
"each serving less than 100,000 people............................................................................................................................................................... 7"
"Map 5: Index of the Ability to Produce Clean Water, 30-meter pixel view. The index of the ability to produce"
"clean water was developed by combining six layers of spatial data: forest and agricultural lands, riparian"
"forest cover, soil erodibility, road density, and housing density. Areas with higher scores have greater ability"
to produce clean water........................................................................................................................................................................................... 15
"Map 6: Index of the Ability to Produce Clean Water, watershed view. The index of the ability to produce"
clean water indicates the probability of finding surface waters of high quality in a watershed.
Higher scores indicate higher probability.......................................................................................................................................................16
"Map 7: Importance of watersheds providing drinking water supply, watershed view. Watersheds with the"
highest scores have the greatest ability to produce high quality water for the largest population..........................................18
"Map 8: Importance of watersheds and private forests for drinking water supplies, watershed view."
Watersheds that scored high in their ability to produce high quality water for the largest population
also scored high in the amount of private forested land they encompassed....................................................................................20
Map 9: Importance of watersheds and private forests for drinking water supplies in the eastern portion
"of the study area, watershed view. Watersheds that scored highest in terms of importance for drinking"
water and for private forests important for drinking water supply were in the eastern portion of the
study area. See table 7 for more information about each watershed. .................................................................................................21
Map 10: Importance of watersheds and private forests for drinking water supplies in the western
"portion of the study area, watershed view. High-scoring watersheds in terms of importance of watersheds and"
private forests for drinking water supply in the western portion of the study area did not score as high as
watersheds in the eastern portion (Map 9). See Table 8 for more information about each watershed. ..................................23
"Map 11: Development pressure on forests and drinking water supplies, watershed view. Watersheds with"
the highest rank and the highest risk of future development are near major cities and metropolitan areas.........................26
Map 12: Development pressure on private forests and drinking water supplies in the eastern portion of the
"study area, watershed view. In the eastern portion of the study area, forested water supply watersheds subject"
to the greatest development pressure are along the Interstate Highway 95 corridor. See Table 9 for more
information about each watershed. .................................................................................................................................................................28
