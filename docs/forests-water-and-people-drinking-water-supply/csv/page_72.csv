Step 3: Add Data on Private Forest Land,Step 3: Add Data on Private Forest Land,,
Step 3 combines the results of Step 2 with the watershed’s,,,
percent private forest to highlight those areas important,,,
for surface water drinking supply that contain private,,,
forest lands. The private forest database was derived using,,,
a subset of the Conservation Biology Institute’s Protected,,,
Areas database and an updated Wisconsin data set. Only,,,
"permanently protected lands (Federal, State, county, local,",,,
or permanent conservation easements) were considered,,,
"“protected,” all other lands were considered unprotected,",,,
having the potential to be developed. The percent private,,,
forest by watershed was divided into 10 quantiles and,,,
then combined with the results of Step 2 to yield a total,,,
score of 3 – 30.,,,
