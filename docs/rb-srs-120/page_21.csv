Introduction,,
Field measurements for this forest inventory,new census area estimates (U.S. Department,
of Virginia began in June 1997 and were,"of Commerce, Bureau of the Census 2000).",
completed in February 2002. Although,,
measurements were spread over several,Virginia includes a variety of physiographic,
"years, this survey is dated 2001. The six",provinces (fig. 1). The Appalachian Plateaus,
previous surveys and State analytical reports,form the western boundary of the State,
"were completed in 1940 (Craig 1949), 1957",,
"(Larson and Bryan 1959), 1966 (Knight",,
"and McClure 1967), 1977 (Knight and",,
"McClure 1978), 1986 (Bechtold and others",,
"1987), and 1992 (Thompson and Johnson",,
1994). Numerous other publications were,,
developed from these previous surveys.,,
The tables and figures in this report,,
"present data for the 2001 survey, as well as",,
estimates of trends. Most trend estimates are,,
based on comparisons of data from the 2001,,
and 1992 surveys. The appendices describe,,
"survey methods, discuss data reliability,",,
"define terms, list tree species sampled in the",,
"survey, and provide standard tables.",,
"During the survey, 4,404 plots were visited,",,
"3,037 of which were at least partially",,

Land area for Virginia in 2001 totaled,,

acres). This difference was due to the use of,,
