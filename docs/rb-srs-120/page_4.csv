,Welcome...
,The distribution and composition of Virginia’s forests have changed dramatically since the
,first European colonists landed in Jamestown 400 years ago. While forests still cover nearly
,"two-thirds of the State, they are continually changing—but where and how? To ensure"
,"that all Virginians continue to realize the many benefits provided by their forests, we must"
,have information we can use to assess the condition of this resource and determine where
,"and how it is changing. Since the 1930s, the U.S. Forest Service has provided the means for"
Carl E. Garrison III,tracking the changes in Virginia’s forests through the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA)
,"program, which conducts physical inventories of public and private land, nationwide, at"
,regular time intervals.
,"Recently, FIA has approached this inventory in a new way by forming partnerships with"
,State forestry organizations. The working partnership between the Virginia Department
,of Forestry and the U.S. Forest Service Southern Research Station FIA Program has
,strengthened and improved the forest inventory of Virginia.
Peter J. Roussopoulos,This report contains information about the forest land of the Commonwealth of Virginia that
,"can be used by decision makers, foresters, landowners, loggers, industry producers, students,"
,and researchers in forestry and related fields. Information about timber volume and the
,"number of trees present cannot fully describe the status of forest resources. Thus, this report"
,includes information about forest health and an evaluation of the goals and objectives of
,Virginia’s forest landowners.
,It is with great pride that we present this report about the forests of Virginia. We view it as
,the first product of a partnership that will deliver the best and most useful information about
,Virginia’s forests now and in the future.
