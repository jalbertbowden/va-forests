,Welcome...
,The distribution and composition of Virginia’s forests have changed dramatically since the
,first European colonists landed in Jamestown 400 years ago. While forests still cover nearly
,"two-thirds of the State, they are continually changing—but where and how? To ensure"
,"that all Virginians continue to realize the many benefits provided by their forests, we must"
,have information we can use to assess the condition of this resource and determine where
,"and how it is changing. Since the 1930s, the U.S. Forest Service has provided the means for"
Carl E. Garrison III,tracking the changes in Virginia’s forests through the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA)
,"program, which conducts physical inventories of public and private land, nationwide, at"
,regular time intervals.
,"Recently, FIA has approached this inventory in a new way by forming partnerships with"
,State forestry organizations. The working partnership between the Virginia Department
,of Forestry and the U.S. Forest Service Southern Research Station FIA Program has
,strengthened and improved the forest inventory of Virginia.
Peter J. Roussopoulos,This report contains information about the forest land of the Commonwealth of Virginia that
,"can be used by decision makers, foresters, landowners, loggers, industry producers, students,"
,and researchers in forestry and related fields. Information about timber volume and the
,"number of trees present cannot fully describe the status of forest resources. Thus, this report"
,includes information about forest health and an evaluation of the goals and objectives of
,Virginia’s forest landowners.
,It is with great pride that we present this report about the forests of Virginia. We view it as
,the first product of a partnership that will deliver the best and most useful information about
,Virginia’s forests now and in the future.

Introduction,,
Field measurements for this forest inventory,new census area estimates (U.S. Department,
of Virginia began in June 1997 and were,"of Commerce, Bureau of the Census 2000).",
completed in February 2002. Although,,
measurements were spread over several,Virginia includes a variety of physiographic,
"years, this survey is dated 2001. The six",provinces (fig. 1). The Appalachian Plateaus,
previous surveys and State analytical reports,form the western boundary of the State,
"were completed in 1940 (Craig 1949), 1957",,
"(Larson and Bryan 1959), 1966 (Knight",,
"and McClure 1967), 1977 (Knight and",,
"McClure 1978), 1986 (Bechtold and others",,
"1987), and 1992 (Thompson and Johnson",,
1994). Numerous other publications were,,
developed from these previous surveys.,,
The tables and figures in this report,,
"present data for the 2001 survey, as well as",,
estimates of trends. Most trend estimates are,,
based on comparisons of data from the 2001,,
and 1992 surveys. The appendices describe,,
"survey methods, discuss data reliability,",,
"define terms, list tree species sampled in the",,
"survey, and provide standard tables.",,

Stand Structure,
Stand Age,"trees is difficult and highly subjective,"
,especially as stands become older (when
The distribution of tree ages within a stand,more time has passed since disturbance
"may vary, from one in which all trees",or stand initiation) and as stand structure
are of a single age (even aged) to one in,and composition become more complex.
which trees are of a multitude of ages,Because of the procedures used by FIA in
(uneven aged). Disturbance and frequency,"assessing stand age, stand age is closely"
of disturbances affect the age distribution,correlated to stand size.
"of stems in a stand. In addition, the age",
distributions can change as a stand matures,
naturally. A stand may be even aged,
following the stand initiation and stem,
exclusion stages but may widen its age,
distribution range during the understory,
reinitiation stage. Older stands and true,
old-growth stands are composed of trees of,
various ages. For these reasons it may be,
difficult to determine a single stand age for,
any given stand. Under such a wide range,
"of possible scenarios of stand development,",
identifying whether a stand is composed of,
a single cohort or multiple cohorts may be,
difficult also (Oliver and Larson 1990).,
Stand age was determined for the current,
inventory by averaging the ages of at least,
three dominant or codominant trees on,
each sample plot condition. The procedure,
depended on stand structure. For stands,
in which the dominant or codominant,
"trees were in the same layer, stand age was",
calculated as the average age of three trees,
in this layer. For stands with two distinct,
"layers, the average age of the dominant",
or codominant trees in the predominant,
layer was used. Forest stands that had more,
than two layers were assigned an age that,
reflected the average age for all dominant,
and codominant trees in the stand. Aging,
stands by dominant and codominant trees,
"yields an age of the largest trees, and the",
largest trees are not always the oldest,
ones in the stand. This anomaly is often,
observed in stands that are further into the,
"successional cycle, when shade-tolerant",
late-successional species become more,
important in stand structure and dynamics.,

"Between 1997 and 2001, the Forest Service’s Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Program"
"conducted the seventh inventory of the forests of Virginia. About 15,844,000 acres, or 62"
"percent, of Virginia was forested. The majority (12,102,000 acres) of Virginia’s forest land was"
in nonindustrial private forest ownership. Public ownership and forest industry ranked second
"and third, with 2,718,000 and 1,024,000 acres, respectively. Red maple dominated in terms of"
number of live stems (≥ 1.0 inch d.b.h.) with 1.5 billion stems (13 percent of total). Loblolly pine
"was second, with 959 million live stems, 72 percent of which were in stands classified as planted."
"Yellow-poplar, sweetgum, and blackgum ranked third, fourth, and fifth, respectively, by number"
of stems. Yellow-poplar dominated the total live-tree volume with 5.5 billion cubic feet (13 percent
"of total). Loblolly pine was the second most dominant species, with 4.7 billion cubic feet (11"
"percent of total). Chestnut oak, white oak, and red maple ranked next in total live-tree volume."
"Across Virginia, 95 percent of forest health plots had an average crown dieback ≤ 7.5 percent."
Scarlet oak and sourwood had the highest percentage of trees with ≥ 7.5 percent dieback. FIA is
the only program that conducts forest assessments across all land in the United States. Increasing
demands on the resource and anthropogenic-related impacts on forests have intensified the need
to conduct ecosystem-based inventories such as these.

principle of multiple use management of the Nation’s forest resources for sustained
"yields of wood, water, forage, wildlife, and recreation. Through forestry research,"
