old-growth stands as well as in young early,
successional stands.,
"Of the four hardwoods mapped, chestnut",
oak showed the most restricted distribution.,
This species is often found on dry upland,
sites (Eyre 1980). In the Appalachian,
"region, it typically grows on intermediate-",
to-poor sites where it is considered to be the,
physiographic climax (Burns and Honkala,
1990). Eighty-four percent of the chestnut,
oak live-tree volume was in stands > 60,
years of age. Seventy-one percent of the,
volume of this species was in the Southern,
and Northern Mountains. It was one of the,
few species (which also included pitch pine,
and Table Mountain pine) that showed a,
strong affinity for the dry tops of ridges.,
Forty-seven percent of the chestnut oak,
live-tree volume occurred in areas in this,
physiographic class.,
