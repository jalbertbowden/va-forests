varies with lichen morphology: fruticose,,
lichens are more sensitive than foliose,,
"lichens, which are more sensitive than",,
"crustose lichens (Haffner and others 2001,",,
Hutchinson and others 1996).,,
Data about lichen occurrence can reflect,,
changes in forest biodiversity and may,,
provide early warnings when serious,,
conditions are developing.,,
"As biomonitors, lichens can be collected",,
and analyzed for accumulations of specific,,
"compounds, such as lead, in their tissues.",,
Lichen communities can also be assessed,,
for species richness and diversity. Existing,,
lichen community parameters and changes,,
in these communities over time may be,,
correlated with climate and air quality,,
"data, with the goal of using lichens as",,
early warning indicators of potential,,
forest health degradation (McCune 2000).,,
McCune and others (1997) found that in,,
"the Southeastern United States, climate",,
and air quality explained 59 percent of,,
the variation in lichen communities.,,
"Generally, species richness was greatest in",,
the Southern and Northern Mountains and,,
decreased across the Piedmont and onto,,
the Coastal Plain. Species richness and the,,
number of sensitive species also decreased,,
as air quality declined. Two separate lichen,,
"gradients were calculated, one for climate",,
"and one for air quality, for the southeastern",,
"region, including Virginia, North Carolina,",,Lichens are considered
,"only to genus, and two unknowns that",biomonitors of air quality.
