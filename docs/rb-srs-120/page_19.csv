•	 Net annual growth for all live trees on,
timberland for the survey period was 990.0,
"million cubic feet per year, an increase",
of 14.5 percent over the previous survey,
"period. Since the 1992 survey, Virginia’s",
live-tree removals have averaged 697.9,
million cubic feet per year. This was an,
increase of 11.3 percent over the previous,
"survey period. Overall, the ratio between",
live net growth and live removals was,
1.42:1. This indicates that net growth,
exceeded harvesting in Virginia.,
"•	 Across the State, average annual mortality",
was 333.6 million cubic feet per year. This,
was a 46-percent increase from the previous,
inventory. Thirty-six percent of the current,
survey’s mortality was in softwoods and 64,
percent in hardwoods.,
•	 Weather-caused disturbance affected an,
estimated 7 percent of Virginia’s timberland,
between 1992 and 2002. Insect damage,
was the next most significant natural,
"disturbance, affecting 3 percent of",
the timberland.,
