 | VIRGINIA’S FORESTS,• OUR COMMON WEALTH
,Risks to the Resource
,"There are risks involved with any long-term investment, and this"
,is especially true with growing timber. Virginia’s forests have been
,"impacted with insect and disease outbreaks, ice storms, tropical storms"
,"and hurricanes, floods, drought, and other natural disasters that have"
,damaged or killed thousands of acres of trees. Although some of this
,"timber was salvaged, the loss to landowners was still millions of dollars."
,"Specific risks include native insects, such as the southern pine beetle,"
,which can reach outbreak numbers every 10 to 15 years and cause
,widespread destruction to the pine resource. Even more serious are
,"invasive species in the form of insects, diseases and weeds. Gypsy moth"
,and hemlock woolly adelgid are two invasive insects that have been
,established in Virginia for decades and have caused widespread mortality
,"to oaks and hemlocks, respectively. Newer threats from invasive insects"
,"include the emerald ash borer, Asian longhorned beetle and European"
,woodwasp.
,Virginia’s urban forests are also at risk from a wide variety of threats
,"including: lack of maintenance, storms, exotic insect pests and improper"
,plant selections. The loss of trees during the development process
,is having a tremendous impact on the composition of future urban
,forests. Most localities lack strong measures to prevent or minimize this
,tree loss.
,"Invasive weed species, such as tree of heaven, multi-flora rose and"
,"Japanese honeysuckle, are particularly troublesome because of their"
,"prolific growth and reproduction, adaptability to a variety of conditions,"
,and ability to invade disturbed sites. Fragmentation and parcelization
,of intact forest creates environments that are extremely vulnerable to
,"invasion by weeds. In many areas of Virginia, at least half of the plant"
,biomass in the forest consists of invasive weeds. This will have profoundly
,negative ecological effects on future forests because less competitive
,native trees and plants will be unable to reestablish themselves on these
,sites without human intervention.
,"Other potential risks to Virginia’s forests are uncontrolled forest fires,"
,land-use changes and forest land management restrictions. The rate of
,conversion of forest land is related to the amount of risk and costs that
,landowners must bear to manage their land. Land-use policies can have
,major impacts on our forest resources.
