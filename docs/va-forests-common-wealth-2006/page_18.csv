18 | VIRGINIA’S FORESTS,• OUR COMMON WEALTH
Forest-related Values,Forest-related Values
,Many benefits of the Commonwealth’s forests are derived not from
,"products, but from experiences and environmental attributes. Virginians"
,"spend many hours hiking, camping, hunting, fishing or taking pictures."
,Forests provide relief from the noise and pollution of industrial areas
,and congested urban sprawl.
,Wildlife-Related Recreation
,"According to the 2001 National Survey of Fishing, Hunting, and"
,"Wildlife-Associated Recreation, more than 3.4 million people, ages 6"
,and older participated in wildlife-related activities in Virginia. Along
,"with non-residents, they spent $1.9 billion on trip-related expenses,"
,"equipment, licenses and other fees. Approximately 80 percent of these"
,"activities, $1.52 billion, are estimated to be associated with the forests"
,of Virginia. 18
,Forest-Related Recreation
,"Backpacking, hiking, camping, forest viewing and other forest-related"
,activities generate a large amount of economic activity. Based on the
,"Virginia Tourism Corporation’s 2003/04 Visitor Survey, it is estimated"
,that 27 million visitors (people traveling more than 50 miles) spent
One of our most basic,more than $918 million in pursuit of these activities. Millions more were
"resources, clean water,",spent by Virginia residents and visitors traveling less than 50 miles. 19
comes from our forests.,Water Quality and Erosion Control
,Forests work as natural filters that remove pollutants from the air and
,water. This natural cleaning process reduces the amount and cost of
,treating water from forested watersheds and riparian areas and helps
,purify the air we breathe. Approximately 50 percent of Virginia’s
,streams have forest buffers. Because of their high value in stabilizing
,"stream banks and reducing sedimentation, storm water"
,"runoff and water pollution, Virginia is investing millions"
,of dollars to protect and increase the extent of riparian
,forests. 20
