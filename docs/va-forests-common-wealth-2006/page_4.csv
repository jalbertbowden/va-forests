Executive Summary,Executive Summary,Executive Summary
,,The economic and social importance of Virginia’s forest resources
,,and the increasing demand for forest products are here to stay. At 7.5
,,"million and growing, the state’s population is placing greater demands"
,,on our remaining forest lands and the benefits they provide. The
,,sustained stewardship of the forest resources and their contribution
,,to the lives of the people of the Commonwealth is the mission of the
,,"Virginia Department of Forestry (VDOF). For 400 years, Virginia’s"
,,forests have been – and continue to be – the backbone to a strong
,,economy and healthy environment. Virginia’s forest products industry
,,provides a vital source of income and jobs to many rural areas and
,,"smaller cities. The harvesting, processing and marketing of forest"
,,products generates more than $25.2 billion annually to Virginia’s
,,"economy and accounts for 183,898 jobs. Opportunities for growth in"
,,"the forest products industry still exist, especially in the areas of value-"
,,added products. Non-timber utilization of Virginia’s forests will also
,,continue to grow.
,,Stronger conservation of the forest land base and a greater knowledge
,,of how forests and people interact are necessary if the benefits of forest
,,lands are to be sustained.
,,“The Virginia Strategy – Prosperity into the New Century” states that
,,key issues to maintaining a thriving forest industry include “availability
,,"of land, availability of capital and awareness on the part of the general"
,,public of the benefits of natural resource based industries.” 1
