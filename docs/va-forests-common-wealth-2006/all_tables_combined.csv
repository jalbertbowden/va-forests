Executive Summary,Executive Summary,Executive Summary
,,The economic and social importance of Virginia’s forest resources
,,and the increasing demand for forest products are here to stay. At 7.5
,,"million and growing, the state’s population is placing greater demands"
,,on our remaining forest lands and the benefits they provide. The
,,sustained stewardship of the forest resources and their contribution
,,to the lives of the people of the Commonwealth is the mission of the
,,"Virginia Department of Forestry (VDOF). For 400 years, Virginia’s"
,,forests have been – and continue to be – the backbone to a strong
,,economy and healthy environment. Virginia’s forest products industry
,,provides a vital source of income and jobs to many rural areas and
,,"smaller cities. The harvesting, processing and marketing of forest"
,,products generates more than $25.2 billion annually to Virginia’s
,,"economy and accounts for 183,898 jobs. Opportunities for growth in"
,,"the forest products industry still exist, especially in the areas of value-"
,,added products. Non-timber utilization of Virginia’s forests will also
,,continue to grow.
,,Stronger conservation of the forest land base and a greater knowledge
,,of how forests and people interact are necessary if the benefits of forest
,,lands are to be sustained.
,,“The Virginia Strategy – Prosperity into the New Century” states that
,,key issues to maintaining a thriving forest industry include “availability
,,"of land, availability of capital and awareness on the part of the general"
,,public of the benefits of natural resource based industries.” 1

,is especially true with growing timber. Virginia’s forests have been
,"impacted with insect and disease outbreaks, ice storms, tropical storms"
,"and hurricanes, floods, drought, and other natural disasters that have"
,damaged or killed thousands of acres of trees. Although some of this
,"timber was salvaged, the loss to landowners was still millions of dollars."
,"Specific risks include native insects, such as the southern pine beetle,"
,which can reach outbreak numbers every 10 to 15 years and cause
,widespread destruction to the pine resource. Even more serious are
,"invasive species in the form of insects, diseases and weeds. Gypsy moth"
,and hemlock woolly adelgid are two invasive insects that have been
,established in Virginia for decades and have caused widespread mortality
,"to oaks and hemlocks, respectively. Newer threats from invasive insects"
,"include the emerald ash borer, Asian longhorned beetle and European"
,woodwasp.
,Virginia’s urban forests are also at risk from a wide variety of threats
,"including: lack of maintenance, storms, exotic insect pests and improper"
,plant selections. The loss of trees during the development process
,is having a tremendous impact on the composition of future urban
,forests. Most localities lack strong measures to prevent or minimize this
,tree loss.
,"Invasive weed species, such as tree of heaven, multi-flora rose and"
,"Japanese honeysuckle, are particularly troublesome because of their"
,"prolific growth and reproduction, adaptability to a variety of conditions,"
,and ability to invade disturbed sites. Fragmentation and parcelization
,of intact forest creates environments that are extremely vulnerable to
,"invasion by weeds. In many areas of Virginia, at least half of the plant"
,biomass in the forest consists of invasive weeds. This will have profoundly
,negative ecological effects on future forests because less competitive
,native trees and plants will be unable to reestablish themselves on these
,sites without human intervention.
,"Other potential risks to Virginia’s forests are uncontrolled forest fires,"
,land-use changes and forest land management restrictions. The rate of
,conversion of forest land is related to the amount of risk and costs that
,landowners must bear to manage their land. Land-use policies can have
,major impacts on our forest resources.

,"According to the 2001 National Survey of Fishing, Hunting, and"
,"Wildlife-Associated Recreation, more than 3.4 million people, ages 6"
,and older participated in wildlife-related activities in Virginia. Along
,"with non-residents, they spent $1.9 billion on trip-related expenses,"
,"equipment, licenses and other fees. Approximately 80 percent of these"
,"activities, $1.52 billion, are estimated to be associated with the forests"
,of Virginia. 18
,Forest-Related Recreation
,"Backpacking, hiking, camping, forest viewing and other forest-related"
,activities generate a large amount of economic activity. Based on the
,"Virginia Tourism Corporation’s 2003/04 Visitor Survey, it is estimated"
,that 27 million visitors (people traveling more than 50 miles) spent
One of our most basic,more than $918 million in pursuit of these activities. Millions more were
"resources, clean water,",spent by Virginia residents and visitors traveling less than 50 miles. 19
comes from our forests.,Water Quality and Erosion Control
,Forests work as natural filters that remove pollutants from the air and
,water. This natural cleaning process reduces the amount and cost of
,treating water from forested watersheds and riparian areas and helps
,purify the air we breathe. Approximately 50 percent of Virginia’s
,streams have forest buffers. Because of their high value in stabilizing
,"stream banks and reducing sedimentation, storm water"
,"runoff and water pollution, Virginia is investing millions"
,of dollars to protect and increase the extent of riparian
,forests. 20
