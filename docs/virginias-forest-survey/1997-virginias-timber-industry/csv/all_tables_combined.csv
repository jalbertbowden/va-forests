"In 1995, roundwood output from Virginia’s forests totaled more than 455 million cubic"
"feet, 4 percent more than in 1992. Mill byproducts generated from primary manufactur-"
ers increased 3 percent to 167 million cubic feet. Almost 97 percent of the plant
residues were used primarily for fuel and fiber products. Saw logs were the leading
roundwood product at 213 million cubic feet; pulpwood ranked second at 201 million
cubic feet; composite panels were third at 21 million cubic feet. The number of primary
processing plants declined from 311 in 1992 to 289 in 1995. Total receipts increased 3
percent to almost 485 million cubic feet.
