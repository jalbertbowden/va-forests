Disturbance,
Hurricane Isabel,
In September 2003 Hurricane Isabel,
made landfall on the Outer Banks of,
North Carolina. Identified as a category 2,
"hurricane, the storm caused widespread",
wind and flood damage across eight,
States—from North Carolina to New,
York. Isabel passed through Virginia with,
sustained wind speeds ranging from 32 to,
60 knots and with gusts of up to 79 knots,
(Beven and Cobb 2004). Rainfall from the,
hurricane averaged 4 to 7 inches over large,
"portions of east-central Virginia, and rainfall",
in the Shenandoah Valley of northern,
Virginia averaged 8 to 12 inches (Beven,
and Cobb 2004). A total of 77 counties and,
independent cities across Virginia were,
declared disaster zones and the estimated,
"economic loss was $925 million, greater",
than any of the other States through,
which Isabel passed (U.S. Department of,
Commerce 2004). Most weather-related,
disturbance measured during the 2007,
survey occurred in 2003 (fig. 14).,
Hurricane Isabel may help explain why,
removals increased substantially for,
hardwoods in the Northern Piedmont and,"Chesapeake Bay, Grandview Nature Preserve, Hampton, VA. (photo by Anita K. Rose)"
"the Northern Mountains, and increased",
for both hardwoods and softwoods in the,
Coastal Plain. It may also be part of the,
