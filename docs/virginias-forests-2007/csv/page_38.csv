,"Beech bark disease, the interaction of a scale"
,"insect and a fungus, has the potential to"
,alter the character of forests in which beech
,"is a constituent. Fortunately, some beech"
,trees show a natural resistance and the rate
,of spread of this disease is fairly slow (Lovett
,and others 2006). Stem density of beech is
,highest in the Coastal Plain (3.6 trees per
,acre) followed by the Southern Mountains
,(3.2 trees per acre) (table 5).
,Eastern and Carolina hemlock are
,susceptible to many pests and pathogens.
,Of particular concern is the hemlock woolly
,adelgid. Since its introduction into Virginia
,"in the 1950s, this insect has spread to most"
"Emerald ash borer. (photo by David Cappaert, Michigan State",
"University, www.Bugwood.org)",counties where hemlock occurs. Feeding
,"on the phloem of hemlock twigs, tree death"
,typically occurs within 4 to 5 years (Lovett
,and others 2006). Symptoms of adelgid
,"infestation include poor crown condition,"
,conspicuous woollike ovisacs on underside
,"of branch tips, and areas of extensive"
,hemlock mortality and decline (U.S.
,Department of Agriculture Forest Service
,2005). Hemlock is most prevalent in the
,Northern and Southern Mountains (table
,"5), where this insect is expected to cause a"
,marked reduction in hemlock populations.
