Disturbance
reason that mortality increased substantially
for both hardwoods and softwoods in the
Coastal Plain. Another potential impact of
the hurricane was the significant increase
in foliage transparency recorded after
2003 (Randolph and Rose 2009). Only
11 percent of P3 plots measured prior to the
hurricane (2001 through 2003) had average
transparencies of > 25 percent (fig. 15A). In
"contrast, 43 percent of plots measured after"
the hurricane (2004 through 2006) had
average transparencies of > 25 percent
(fig. 15B). This was especially true in the
"Coastal Plain, where 76 percent of plots"
measured after the hurricane had average
"foliage transparencies > 25 percent, while"
only 12 percent did prior to the hurricane.
