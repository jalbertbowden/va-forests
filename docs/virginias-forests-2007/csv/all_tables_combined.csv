,Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA),information needed to formulate sound
,Research Work Unit and cooperating State,forest policies and programs. These data

,"States (Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia,","forest area, forest ownership, forest type,"
,"Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North","stand structure, timber volume, growth,"
,"Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina,","removals, and management activity. In"

Introduction,
Introduction,
Field measurements for this inventory of,
Virginia’s forests began in February 2002,
and were completed in August 2007. Even,
though measurements were spread over,
"several years, the survey is dated 2007.",
"Comparisons, unless otherwise noted, are",
based on estimates from the 2001 and the,
2007 surveys. The seven previous surveys,
and State analytical reports were completed,
"in 1940 (Craig 1949), 1957 (Larson and",
"Bryan 1959), 1966 (Knight and McClure",
"1967), 1977 (Knight and McClure 1978),",
"1986 (Bechtold and others 1987), 1992",
"(Thompson and Johnson 1994), and 2001",
(Rose 2007). Numerous other publications,
were developed using those surveys.,
"With a total of 25.3 million acres of land,",
Virginia includes a variety of physiographic,
provinces (fig. 1). The Appalachian,"Keokee Lake near Appalachia in Lee County, VA. (photo by Harold Jerrell, Lee"
Plateaus form the western border with,"County, VA, Virginia Cooperative Extension)"
North Carolina and are composed of the,
eastern escarpment of the Cumberland,
and Allegheny Mountains. To the east of,
these mountains are the Ridge and Valley,
Province and the Blue Ridge Mountains.,

Disturbance,
Hurricane Isabel,
In September 2003 Hurricane Isabel,
made landfall on the Outer Banks of,
North Carolina. Identified as a category 2,
"hurricane, the storm caused widespread",
wind and flood damage across eight,
States—from North Carolina to New,
York. Isabel passed through Virginia with,
sustained wind speeds ranging from 32 to,
60 knots and with gusts of up to 79 knots,
(Beven and Cobb 2004). Rainfall from the,
hurricane averaged 4 to 7 inches over large,
"portions of east-central Virginia, and rainfall",
in the Shenandoah Valley of northern,
Virginia averaged 8 to 12 inches (Beven,
and Cobb 2004). A total of 77 counties and,
independent cities across Virginia were,
declared disaster zones and the estimated,
"economic loss was $925 million, greater",
than any of the other States through,
which Isabel passed (U.S. Department of,
Commerce 2004). Most weather-related,
disturbance measured during the 2007,
survey occurred in 2003 (fig. 14).,
Hurricane Isabel may help explain why,
removals increased substantially for,
hardwoods in the Northern Piedmont and,"Chesapeake Bay, Grandview Nature Preserve, Hampton, VA. (photo by Anita K. Rose)"
"the Northern Mountains, and increased",
for both hardwoods and softwoods in the,
Coastal Plain. It may also be part of the,

reason that mortality increased substantially
for both hardwoods and softwoods in the
Coastal Plain. Another potential impact of
the hurricane was the significant increase
in foliage transparency recorded after
2003 (Randolph and Rose 2009). Only
11 percent of P3 plots measured prior to the
hurricane (2001 through 2003) had average
transparencies of > 25 percent (fig. 15A). In
"contrast, 43 percent of plots measured after"
the hurricane (2004 through 2006) had
average transparencies of > 25 percent
(fig. 15B). This was especially true in the
"Coastal Plain, where 76 percent of plots"
measured after the hurricane had average
"foliage transparencies > 25 percent, while"
only 12 percent did prior to the hurricane.

13 feet (at maturity).
Tree grade. A classification of the
saw-log portion of sawtimber trees based
on: (1) the grade of the butt log or (2) the
ability to produce at least one 12-foot or
two 8-foot logs in the upper section of the

"Department of Agriculture Forest Service, Southern Research Station. 77 p."
"Between 2002 and 2007, the Forest Service’s Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Program"
"conducted the eighth inventory of the forests of Virginia. About 15.7 million acres, or 62"
"percent, of Virginia was forested. The majority (12.4 million acres) of Virginia’s forest land was"
in nonindustrial private forest ownership. Public ownership and forest industry ranked second
"and third, with 2.8 and 0.6 million acres, respectively. Red maple dominated the number of"
live stems (≥ 1.0 inch d.b.h.) with 1.4 billion stems (13 percent of total). Loblolly pine was
"second, with 1.0 billion live stems. While yellow-poplar was the most dominate species for"
"live-tree volume with 5.0 billion cubic feet (15 percent of total), as a genus, oaks accounted"
for 33 percent of the live-tree volume (10.8 billion cubic feet). Biomass of coarse woody debris
on forest health plots averaged 2.9 tons per acre for the State. The amount of carbon in coarse
"woody debris and fine woody debris averaged 1.4 and 1.7 tons per acre, respectively. The Forest"
Service’s FIA is the only program that conducts forest assessments across all land in the United
States. Increasing demands on the resource and anthropogenic-related impacts on forests have
intensified the need to conduct ecosystem-based inventories such as these.
"Keywords: FIA, forest health, forest inventory, forest land, forest survey, timberland, Virginia."
"The Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), is dedicated to the principle"
"of multiple use management of the Nation’s forest resources for sustained yields of wood,"
"water, forage, wildlife, and recreation. Through forestry research, cooperation with the"
"States and private forest owners, and management of the National Forests and National"
"Grasslands, it strives—as directed by Congress—to provide increasingly greater service"
to a growing Nation.
"The USDA prohibits discrimination in all its programs and activities on the basis of race, color, national"
"origin, age, disability, and where applicable, sex, marital status, familial status, parental status, religion,"
"sexual orientation, genetic information, political beliefs, reprisal, or because all or part"
of an individual’s income is derived from any public assistance program. (Not all prohibited bases
apply to all programs.) Persons with disabilities who require alternative means for communication of
"program information (Braille, large print, audiotape, etc.) should contact USDA’s TARGET Center at"
(202) 720-2600 (voice and TDD).
"To file a complaint of discrimination, write to USDA, Director, Office of Civil Rights, 1400 Independence"
"Avenue, SW, Washington, DC 20250–9410 or call (800) 795-3272 (voice) or (202) 720-6382 (TDD)."
