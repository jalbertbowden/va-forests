"Between 1997 and 2001, the Forest Service’s Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Program"
"conducted the seventh inventory of the forests of Virginia. About 15,844,000 acres, or 62"
"percent, of Virginia was forested. The majority (12,102,000 acres) of Virginia’s forest land was"
in nonindustrial private forest ownership. Public ownership and forest industry ranked second
"and third, with 2,718,000 and 1,024,000 acres, respectively. Red maple dominated in terms of"
number of live stems (≥ 1.0 inch d.b.h.) with 1.5 billion stems (13 percent of total). Loblolly pine
"was second, with 959 million live stems, 72 percent of which were in stands classified as planted."
"Yellow-poplar, sweetgum, and blackgum ranked third, fourth, and fifth, respectively, by number"
of stems. Yellow-poplar dominated the total live-tree volume with 5.5 billion cubic feet (13 percent
"of total). Loblolly pine was the second most dominant species, with 4.7 billion cubic feet (11"
"percent of total). Chestnut oak, white oak, and red maple ranked next in total live-tree volume."
"Across Virginia, 95 percent of forest health plots had an average crown dieback ≤ 7.5 percent."
Scarlet oak and sourwood had the highest percentage of trees with ≥ 7.5 percent dieback. FIA is
the only program that conducts forest assessments across all land in the United States. Increasing
demands on the resource and anthropogenic-related impacts on forests have intensified the need
to conduct ecosystem-based inventories such as these.

"The Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), is dedicated to the"
principle of multiple use management of the Nation’s forest resources for sustained
"yields of wood, water, forage, wildlife, and recreation. Through forestry research,"
"cooperation with the States and private forest owners, and management of the"
"National Forests and National Grasslands, it strives—as directed by Congress—to"
provide increasingly greater service to a growing Nation.
