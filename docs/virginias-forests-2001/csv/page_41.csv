of disturbances affect the age distribution,correlated to stand size.
"of stems in a stand. In addition, the age",
distributions can change as a stand matures,
naturally. A stand may be even aged,
following the stand initiation and stem,
exclusion stages but may widen its age,
distribution range during the understory,
reinitiation stage. Older stands and true,
old-growth stands are composed of trees of,
various ages. For these reasons it may be,
difficult to determine a single stand age for,
any given stand. Under such a wide range,
"of possible scenarios of stand development,",
identifying whether a stand is composed of,
a single cohort or multiple cohorts may be,
difficult also (Oliver and Larson 1990).,
Stand age was determined for the current,
inventory by averaging the ages of at least,
three dominant or codominant trees on,
each sample plot condition. The procedure,
depended on stand structure. For stands,
in which the dominant or codominant,
"trees were in the same layer, stand age was",
calculated as the average age of three trees,
in this layer. For stands with two distinct,
"layers, the average age of the dominant",
or codominant trees in the predominant,
layer was used. Forest stands that had more,
than two layers were assigned an age that,
reflected the average age for all dominant,
and codominant trees in the stand. Aging,
stands by dominant and codominant trees,
"yields an age of the largest trees, and the",
largest trees are not always the oldest,
ones in the stand. This anomaly is often,
observed in stands that are further into the,
"successional cycle, when shade-tolerant",
late-successional species become more,
important in stand structure and dynamics.,
