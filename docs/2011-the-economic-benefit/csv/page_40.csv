billion probably underestimates the overall contribution of natural goods and services to
Virginia’s economy.
Virginia has enjoyed over a decade of sustained economic prosperity by any measure.
"Fortune 500 companies, small businesses, startups, skilled workers and young talent have"
flocked to the state in recent years to reap the benefits of this growth. In-state GDP has
dramatically outperformed the national average and has matched the pace of many fast growing
East Asian economies over the last 15 years. The key to Virginia’s success has been the diversity
"of its economic interests, which range from knowledge-based service industries, to higher"
"education, to manufacturing, to agriculture, to defense contracting, to forestry, to mining, and to"
"tourism. As with any well performing business, it is important to take stock of the company’s"
"value-generating assets, which includes Virginia’s natural resources."
This report offers a baseline estimate of the contribution of those assets to the
commonwealth’s economic success and wellbeing. The elected stewards of these public goods
"have long recognized their cultural heritage and aesthetic value, as have the voters through a"
series of conservation referendums. Successive governors from opposing political parties have
now called for identical conservation targets. While still fundamentally an act of preservation
"and not a financial investment, land conservation entails the preservation of natural services and"
"the protection of traditional industries. It maintains the diversity of the economy, enhances the"
"quality of life of the state’s residence, and provides cost-saving services. While it will never be"
"possible to fully articulate the worth of open space in monetary terms, it is simultaneously"
important to not discount its realizable value.
