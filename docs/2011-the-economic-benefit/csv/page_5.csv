"resources and not willingness to pay, which favors the first set of methods."
"Virginia’s voters, businesses, trade groups, and two most recent Governors have"
commented on the value of the state’s natural resources in different terms. Economic value may
"not necessarily be the first concern among outdoors appreciators, but it is significant. This report"
represents the first attempt to quantify the annual contribution of these assets to Virginia’s
economy in the hopes that policy makers and business owners may better account for them in the
planning for the next phase of economic prosperity within the Old Dominion.
