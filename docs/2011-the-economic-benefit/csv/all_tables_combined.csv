,"On a per acre basis, the most valuable land cover type was sand and clay as it"
encompasses the Commonwealth’s relatively limited beaches. As these both defend against,
"ocean erosion and host a tourism industry that draws over a billion dollars in annual revenue,",
"they are the most valuable land cover type. However, merely by virtue of comprising 42.8",
"percent of the state’s land area, deciduous forests provide the most benefit overall. As has been",
"widely determined in environmental economic literature, wetlands are extremely valuable on a",

"significantly more so than similar sites in rural areas, their benefit is not accounted for in the",
developed land cover classes. 2 Instead the forest and grass cover types capture the benefits of,
"parks, playing fields, and green ways.",
,These estimates for natural benefits include both market values for goods such as forest
"and farm products as well as non-market benefits such as water filtration, that save",
municipalities money or generate wealth but which are not evaluated in traditional accounting,

"expenditure, voluntary market, or hedonic analytical methods over those that use contingent"
valuation and group valuation methods. The former group of methods assesses ecosystem service
"values in terms of how much it would cost to replace them, savings they make for a municipal"
"government, or value they add to a home while the latter essentially ask respondents what they"
would be willing to pay to protect a resource. While contingent valuation is accepted academic
"practice, the goal of this project has been to quantify palpable economic impacts of natural"
"resources and not willingness to pay, which favors the first set of methods."
"Virginia’s voters, businesses, trade groups, and two most recent Governors have"
commented on the value of the state’s natural resources in different terms. Economic value may
"not necessarily be the first concern among outdoors appreciators, but it is significant. This report"
represents the first attempt to quantify the annual contribution of these assets to Virginia’s
economy in the hopes that policy makers and business owners may better account for them in the
planning for the next phase of economic prosperity within the Old Dominion.

"Unlike legislative appropriations, general obligation bonds such as those voted on in"
"these referendums usually entail a property or sales tax increase to repay the debt. As such, each"
bond amounts to a self-imposed tax by Virginia voters that has been levied in both strong and
weak economic times. In addition to such instances of indirect or implicit recognition of land’s
"myriad value, thousands of academic and policy studies have quantified the market, non-market,"
and non-use values of natural resources throughout the world. Through the use of these various
"resources, the estimation of a state’s natural resource service value becomes possible."

Articulating Virginia’s Natural Benefits,
,Natural benefits include the economic value of the goods and services provided by
"ecosystems and abiotic sources. These goods include drinking water, timber, mineral deposits,",
"crops and livestock, and have readily quantifiable market values. Natural services are often not",
priced explicitly and can only be quantified through non-market valuation techniques. Some,
"examples include water purification from forests and wetlands, erosion and disturbance",
"prevention from barrier islands, pollination from native insects, habitat provision for marine",
"resources, carbon sequestration, and property value enhancement. This study quantified the",
"economic contribution of nine goods and services within Virginia, its public lands, and lands",
under easement.,
1.,Water Quality
,"Forests, pastures and wetlands absorb excess nutrient runoff as well as toxins from"
"transportation corridors, agricultural enterprises, and industrial sources. High concentrations of",
nitrogen and phosphorus in the Chesapeake Bay have been detrimental to marine resources,

8.,Habitat
,There is no all-encompassing market valuation technique for quantifying the economic
benefit of wildlife habitat. This is largely because those benefits are not fully understood.,

found in biologically diverse ecosystems like coral reefs and tropical rainforests. 23 Mangroves,
and coastal wetlands provide breeding,

feed on pest insects require unbroken,
patches of forest cover in order to,
navigate on their long journeys. Forests,

"market valuation approach, wildlife",

"services. Service values for water quality, pollination, disturbance prevention, habitat, and",
carbon sequestration were all estimated via sources employing one or more of the following,
common methods.,
1.,Travel Cost Method
,This involves surveying visitors to a natural or heritage site to determine the costs they
expended visiting the site. Tourists are asked for their home location and standardized,
assumptions are made to estimate their trip expenditures. After controlling for the substitution,assumptions are made to estimate their trip expenditures. After controlling for the substitution
"effect and a number of demographic variables, an estimate of willingness to pay can be derived","effect and a number of demographic variables, an estimate of willingness to pay can be derived"
by regressing travel costs on the number of trips taken and integrating the resulting function.,
2.,Cost Avoidance & Defensive Expenditure Methods
,These methods estimate an ecosystem service by quantifying what it would cost to replace a
natural function with a mechanical process. Common examples of this are replacing forest and,natural function with a mechanical process. Common examples of this are replacing forest and
wetland water filtration services with water treatment plants or replacing the erosion mitigation,wetland water filtration services with water treatment plants or replacing the erosion mitigation
properties of beaches with dredging or ocean walls.,
3.,Hedonic Price Method

sites almost always results in increased home values.,
4.,Contingent Valuation
,This is a process by which a group of people are asked by some manner what their
willingness is to pay to protect a certain natural resource. The respondents do not actually,
transfer funds and the process is an entirely hypothetical exercise. In all likelihood the,
"respondents will never have visited the site in question. However, surveying in this manner",

resource exists or having the option to eventually see it. No other method answers these,
questions.,
5.,Group Valuation
,This method is very similar to contingent valuation but involves surveying a group of people
instead of individuals. The group then determines its collective willingness to pay to preserve a,instead of individuals. The group then determines its collective willingness to pay to preserve a
resource through an elicitation process.,
6.,Meta-Analysis
,"A meta-analysis occurs after several dozen or hundred studies of a resource, land cover type,"
or methodological type have been conducted. The researcher then takes those studies and,
performs regression analysis of their results and any number of different characteristics to,
discern trends in the analysis. This study relied on several meta-analyses to assess the range of,
values that have been assigned to wetlands and forests in different publications. Meta analyses,
"for ecosystem services usually focus on how the different evaluation methodologies, such as",
"those outlined above, impact overall value estimates. Notably, travel cost and contingent",
valuation studies produce significantly lower estimates for wetlands than cost of replacement,
studies. 29,

billion probably underestimates the overall contribution of natural goods and services to
Virginia’s economy.
Virginia has enjoyed over a decade of sustained economic prosperity by any measure.
"Fortune 500 companies, small businesses, startups, skilled workers and young talent have"
flocked to the state in recent years to reap the benefits of this growth. In-state GDP has
dramatically outperformed the national average and has matched the pace of many fast growing
East Asian economies over the last 15 years. The key to Virginia’s success has been the diversity
"of its economic interests, which range from knowledge-based service industries, to higher"
"education, to manufacturing, to agriculture, to defense contracting, to forestry, to mining, and to"
"tourism. As with any well performing business, it is important to take stock of the company’s"
"value-generating assets, which includes Virginia’s natural resources."
This report offers a baseline estimate of the contribution of those assets to the
commonwealth’s economic success and wellbeing. The elected stewards of these public goods
"have long recognized their cultural heritage and aesthetic value, as have the voters through a"
series of conservation referendums. Successive governors from opposing political parties have
now called for identical conservation targets. While still fundamentally an act of preservation
"and not a financial investment, land conservation entails the preservation of natural services and"
"the protection of traditional industries. It maintains the diversity of the economy, enhances the"
"quality of life of the state’s residence, and provides cost-saving services. While it will never be"
"possible to fully articulate the worth of open space in monetary terms, it is simultaneously"
important to not discount its realizable value.
