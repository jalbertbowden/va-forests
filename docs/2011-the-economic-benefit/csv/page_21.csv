resource through an elicitation process.,
6.,Meta-Analysis
,"A meta-analysis occurs after several dozen or hundred studies of a resource, land cover type,"
or methodological type have been conducted. The researcher then takes those studies and,
performs regression analysis of their results and any number of different characteristics to,
discern trends in the analysis. This study relied on several meta-analyses to assess the range of,
values that have been assigned to wetlands and forests in different publications. Meta analyses,
"for ecosystem services usually focus on how the different evaluation methodologies, such as",
"those outlined above, impact overall value estimates. Notably, travel cost and contingent",
valuation studies produce significantly lower estimates for wetlands than cost of replacement,
studies. 29,
