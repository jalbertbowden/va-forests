"services. Service values for water quality, pollination, disturbance prevention, habitat, and",
carbon sequestration were all estimated via sources employing one or more of the following,
common methods.,
1.,Travel Cost Method
,This involves surveying visitors to a natural or heritage site to determine the costs they
expended visiting the site. Tourists are asked for their home location and standardized,
assumptions are made to estimate their trip expenditures. After controlling for the substitution,assumptions are made to estimate their trip expenditures. After controlling for the substitution

by regressing travel costs on the number of trips taken and integrating the resulting function.,
2.,Cost Avoidance & Defensive Expenditure Methods
,These methods estimate an ecosystem service by quantifying what it would cost to replace a
natural function with a mechanical process. Common examples of this are replacing forest and,natural function with a mechanical process. Common examples of this are replacing forest and
wetland water filtration services with water treatment plants or replacing the erosion mitigation,wetland water filtration services with water treatment plants or replacing the erosion mitigation
properties of beaches with dredging or ocean walls.,
3.,Hedonic Price Method
,This method quantifies an ecosystem service by evaluating the impact of a natural resource

sites almost always results in increased home values.,
4.,Contingent Valuation
,This is a process by which a group of people are asked by some manner what their
willingness is to pay to protect a certain natural resource. The respondents do not actually,
transfer funds and the process is an entirely hypothetical exercise. In all likelihood the,
"respondents will never have visited the site in question. However, surveying in this manner",
