Virginia Outdoors Foundation | Fiscal Year 2008 Annual Report
A bout the V irginia O utdoors Foundation
The Virginia Outdoors Foundation was created by the General Assembly in 1966 “to promote the preservation
"of open-space lands and to encourage private gifts of money, securities, land or other property to preserve the natural,"
"scenic, historic, scientific, open-space and recreational areas of the Commonwealth.” VOF currently holds about 480,000"
"acres of donated conservation easements in 90 counties and 12 cities, making VOF’s portfolio of more than 2,250"
"preservation and conservation easements the largest in the nation. It also owns about 3,500 acres of public land in four"
"counties, including 2,500 acres in the Bull Run Mountains."
"A Powerful, Cost-Effective Tool for Land Conservation"
"Conservation easements—their negotiation, acquisition, recordation, and stewardship—are the heart and soul of"
VOF. An easement is a voluntary legal tool that a landowner can use to restrict future activities on his or her land to
protect its conservation values. The value of a conservation easement is the difference between the property’s fair market
"value before and after the imposition of the restrictions. VOF assists landowners with donating easements, as well as"
managing them in perpetuity after they have been recorded. This stewardship process involves landowner support and
"assistance relating to interpretation of specific easement provisions, and also some education related to land management"
"practices. It also requires a great deal of documentation, site visits, and, when necessary, settling easement violations."
Easements provide landowners with control over how their land will be used in perpetuity while protecting public
"values. Some eased properties offer recreational and educational opportunities. Others are working farms and forests,"
generating millions of dollars and thousands of jobs for the Commonwealth. All of them provided the incalculable
"benefits of open space, wildlife habitat, and scenic landscapes—all of which enhance the quality of life for Virginians at"
very little cost to taxpayers.
Partnerships
"Partnerships with other state, federal, and local government agencies, local and regional land trusts, private,"
"nonprofit organizations, and the private sector are critical to the ongoing success of the Virginia Outdoors Foundation."
"Among state agencies, a particularly close working relationship is maintained with the Virginia Department of"
"Conservation and Recreation, the Virginia Department of Forestry, and the Virginia Department of Historic Resources."
VOF also is an active member of Virginia United Land Trusts and Land Trust Alliance.
Funding Sources
"VOF receives its operating capital from several sources. In Fiscal Year 2008, VOF was allocated $2.25 million from"
"the Commonwealth of Virginia General Fund, as well as XXXX from the Virginia Land Conservation Fund. VOF also"
"receives dedicated, but recently declining, funding each year tied to the $1.00 recordation fee imposed on land transfers"
"in any Virginia county or city with at least one recorded open-space easement held by VOF. In addition, VOF seeks"
"grants from foundations, corporations, and individual donors. The VOF Annual Financial Statements for Fiscal Year"
2008 are included in this report.

The Virginia Outdoors Foundations serves the Commonwealth through seven regional offices (see map on page 11).
Appalachian Highlands Region
"Our Abingdon office, which opened in 2006, has worked closely with The Land Trust for Southwest Virginia to"
initiate an outreach program to inform landowners and local leaders within the Appalachian Highlands region about
"conservation easements. During FY 2008, more and more landowners began to contact VOF and place easements on"
"their properties. Interest in easements has continued to increase, with neighbors and relatives of easement donors calling"
the Abingdon office to begin the easement process for their own properties. As the number of easement donors increase
"in the Appalachian Highlands region, there will be more positive testimonials, resulting in a robust easement program in"
the most pristine and unspoiled part of Virginia.
Central Region
"Our Central regional office saw new easements in 12 different counties, with a large proportion of working family"
farms and farms of historic significance. Two designated Virginia Century Farms (working farms in the same family
"for over 100 years) were put under easement. In Amherst County, a large farm that is newly under easement contains"
"the historic Galt’s Mill and fronts the James River, affording wonderful sweeping views to those who pass by in car or"
"canoe. Orange County saw a dozen active farm properties join the easement program, including Rockwood, a designated"
"Historic Register property adjoining historic Montpelier, home of President James Madison. Finally, landowners in"
"the region’s southern counties increased their participation in the easement program, with an historic dairy farm near"
"Keysville and five other properties totaling 1,245 acres in Halifax."
Southeast Region
Many of the easements recorded in the Southeast region in FY 2008 were clustered in the farmlands of western
Hanover County and the working timberlands of southern Virginia. Several farms owned by different generations of one
"family were placed into easement, along with several other neighboring farms in the Beaverdam area. Important historic"
"houses were preserved with their settings, including Springfield, which is listed on the National Register of Historic"
Places and the Virginia Historic Landmarks Register. Three of the farms are contiguous and have frontage along the
"Little River and the Newfound River. This grouping now protects more than 1,300 acres of cropland, pastureland, and"
timberland in a rapidly developing county. Protecting contiguous land is an important conservation strategy that helps
"maintain soils and natural processes, provides wildlife corridors, and allows for more efficient use of farmland. With some"
"of the largest intact properties left in the state and a strong timber industry, this region will benefit greatly from VOF’s"
work in the coming years.
Tidewater Region
"The Tidewater regional office worked on a wide variety of easement projects in FY 2008, most notably preserving"
"important riparian areas and historic properties. In upper Essex County, approximately 1,200 acres of prime forest and"
farmland were protected in an area that already contains a large amount of easements and other conserved lands. Several
"miles of tidal shoreline and associated wetlands were protected on the Rappahannock and Potomac rivers, as well as"
"important swamp areas on Dragon Run, which will enhance water quality preservation and improvement efforts in the"
Chesapeake Bay. Several multi-generational family farms were protected on the Northern Neck and Middle Peninsula. In
"addition, VOF worked with the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation and the Virginia Department of Historic Resources"
"to permanently preserve Carter’s Grove, a 400-acre plantation with over one mile of shoreline on the James River just"
below Williamsburg.

Northern Piedmont Region
"In the Northern Piedmont region, VOF recorded almost two dozen easements in FY 2008, in counties ranging"
from the more urban Prince William County to the more rural Rappahannock County. One of the most significant and
"exciting trends of the year was the number of projects and acres recorded in Loudoun County, which has experienced"
enormous growth in the past several years. The six projects VOF completed in the county in FY 2008 averaged 350 acres
"in size. These projects protect not just open space, but also four historic homes (including one on the National Register"
"of Historic Places), two archeological sites, the viewshed of two highly-traveled commuter routes and two public parks,"
"and the watershed along several miles of major waterways, including Pantherskin Creek and the Potomac River."
Shenandoah Valley Region
"Of the 60-plus easements recorded in the Shenandoah Valley region in FY 2008, more than one-third were on lands"
that have been in the same family for at least three generations. Protecting blocks of agricultural land helps to sustain an
"agricultural economy in addition to preserving valuable farmland in Virginia. In FY 2008, Rockbridge County preserved"
more acres than any other county in the Commonwealth as landowners learned the benefits of easements and began to
spread the word. The surge of interest in land conservation in the Shenandoah Valley is unmatched by any other region
of the state.
Southwest Region
"In the Southwest region, VOF recorded easements in more than a dozen localities, including the first conservation"
"easement ever recorded in the City of Roanoke, as well as more than 6,000 acres in Carvins Cove Natural Reserve,"
located in Roanoke and Botetourt counties—VOF’s largest easement ever. Family lands comprised some of the
"outstanding highlights in the region. In Wythe County, a family donated four easements on their dairy farm, covering"
"nearly 740 acres. In Montgomery and Floyd Counties, a major estate was settled that placed more than 1,400 acres of"
"family farms and land under easement, including a historic home, globally rare species habitat, more than a mile of the"
"Little River, and hundreds of acres of prime farmland."

Virginia Outdoors Foundation | Fiscal Year 2008 Annual Report
O pen S pace L ands Preservation Trust Fund
Recognizing the importance of open-space land in the Commonwealth and the increasing development pressures on
"such land, the General Assembly of Virginia in 1997 created the Open Space Lands Preservation Trust Fund [Va. Code"
Ann. Sections 10.1801-2 (Repl. Vol. 2006)] to assist landowners with the costs of donating open-space easements and to
assist in purchasing all or part of the value of such easements. The Preservation Trust Fund (PTF) is capitalized through a
25-percent appropriation of the state General Fund allocation for the Virginia Land Conservation Foundation. In Fiscal
"Year 2008, the PTF received $1.1 million."
Easements receiving PTF allocations are conveyed to the Virginia Outdoors Foundation and a local easement co-
"holder. Landowners of property with scenic, scientific, natural, historic, recreational, or open-space value may qualify for"
PTF allocations. Each prospective conservation easement is evaluated by VOF staff and its Board of Trustees using the
"VOF guidelines for accepting easements. Expenditures that may be reimbursed by PTF monies include legal expenses,"
"appraisal costs, and other costs incurred related to the easement donation, as well as the purchase price of all or part of"
the value of the easement.
The vast majority of Preservation Trust Fund awards have been for payment of costs associated with the donation of
"an easement on a family farm by owners of modest financial means. For most PTF applicants, the costs associated with"
"the grant of an easement create an impediment to such easement donation, and the PTF awards can make it feasible"
"for such landowners to proceed with their gifts of easements to the Commonwealth. In Fiscal Year 2008, these awards"
"fostered the protection of more than 9,400 acres of land."
