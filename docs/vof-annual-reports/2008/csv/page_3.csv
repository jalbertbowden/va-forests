Virginia Outdoors Foundation | Fiscal Year 2008 Annual Report
A bout the V irginia O utdoors Foundation
The Virginia Outdoors Foundation was created by the General Assembly in 1966 “to promote the preservation
"of open-space lands and to encourage private gifts of money, securities, land or other property to preserve the natural,"
"scenic, historic, scientific, open-space and recreational areas of the Commonwealth.” VOF currently holds about 480,000"
"acres of donated conservation easements in 90 counties and 12 cities, making VOF’s portfolio of more than 2,250"
"preservation and conservation easements the largest in the nation. It also owns about 3,500 acres of public land in four"
"counties, including 2,500 acres in the Bull Run Mountains."
"A Powerful, Cost-Effective Tool for Land Conservation"
"Conservation easements—their negotiation, acquisition, recordation, and stewardship—are the heart and soul of"
VOF. An easement is a voluntary legal tool that a landowner can use to restrict future activities on his or her land to
protect its conservation values. The value of a conservation easement is the difference between the property’s fair market
"value before and after the imposition of the restrictions. VOF assists landowners with donating easements, as well as"
managing them in perpetuity after they have been recorded. This stewardship process involves landowner support and
"assistance relating to interpretation of specific easement provisions, and also some education related to land management"
"practices. It also requires a great deal of documentation, site visits, and, when necessary, settling easement violations."
Easements provide landowners with control over how their land will be used in perpetuity while protecting public
"values. Some eased properties offer recreational and educational opportunities. Others are working farms and forests,"
generating millions of dollars and thousands of jobs for the Commonwealth. All of them provided the incalculable
"benefits of open space, wildlife habitat, and scenic landscapes—all of which enhance the quality of life for Virginians at"
very little cost to taxpayers.
Partnerships
"Partnerships with other state, federal, and local government agencies, local and regional land trusts, private,"
"nonprofit organizations, and the private sector are critical to the ongoing success of the Virginia Outdoors Foundation."
"Among state agencies, a particularly close working relationship is maintained with the Virginia Department of"
"Conservation and Recreation, the Virginia Department of Forestry, and the Virginia Department of Historic Resources."
VOF also is an active member of Virginia United Land Trusts and Land Trust Alliance.
Funding Sources
"VOF receives its operating capital from several sources. In Fiscal Year 2008, VOF was allocated $2.25 million from"
"the Commonwealth of Virginia General Fund, as well as XXXX from the Virginia Land Conservation Fund. VOF also"
"receives dedicated, but recently declining, funding each year tied to the $1.00 recordation fee imposed on land transfers"
"in any Virginia county or city with at least one recorded open-space easement held by VOF. In addition, VOF seeks"
"grants from foundations, corporations, and individual donors. The VOF Annual Financial Statements for Fiscal Year"
2008 are included in this report.
