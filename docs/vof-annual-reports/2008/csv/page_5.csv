Northern Piedmont Region
"In the Northern Piedmont region, VOF recorded almost two dozen easements in FY 2008, in counties ranging"
from the more urban Prince William County to the more rural Rappahannock County. One of the most significant and
"exciting trends of the year was the number of projects and acres recorded in Loudoun County, which has experienced"
enormous growth in the past several years. The six projects VOF completed in the county in FY 2008 averaged 350 acres
"in size. These projects protect not just open space, but also four historic homes (including one on the National Register"
"of Historic Places), two archeological sites, the viewshed of two highly-traveled commuter routes and two public parks,"
"and the watershed along several miles of major waterways, including Pantherskin Creek and the Potomac River."
Shenandoah Valley Region
"Of the 60-plus easements recorded in the Shenandoah Valley region in FY 2008, more than one-third were on lands"
that have been in the same family for at least three generations. Protecting blocks of agricultural land helps to sustain an
"agricultural economy in addition to preserving valuable farmland in Virginia. In FY 2008, Rockbridge County preserved"
more acres than any other county in the Commonwealth as landowners learned the benefits of easements and began to
spread the word. The surge of interest in land conservation in the Shenandoah Valley is unmatched by any other region
of the state.
Southwest Region
"In the Southwest region, VOF recorded easements in more than a dozen localities, including the first conservation"
"easement ever recorded in the City of Roanoke, as well as more than 6,000 acres in Carvins Cove Natural Reserve,"
located in Roanoke and Botetourt counties—VOF’s largest easement ever. Family lands comprised some of the
"outstanding highlights in the region. In Wythe County, a family donated four easements on their dairy farm, covering"
"nearly 740 acres. In Montgomery and Floyd Counties, a major estate was settled that placed more than 1,400 acres of"
"family farms and land under easement, including a historic home, globally rare species habitat, more than a mile of the"
"Little River, and hundreds of acres of prime farmland."
