Virginia Outdoors Foundation | Fiscal Year 2008 Annual Report
O pen S pace L ands Preservation Trust Fund
Recognizing the importance of open-space land in the Commonwealth and the increasing development pressures on
"such land, the General Assembly of Virginia in 1997 created the Open Space Lands Preservation Trust Fund [Va. Code"
Ann. Sections 10.1801-2 (Repl. Vol. 2006)] to assist landowners with the costs of donating open-space easements and to
assist in purchasing all or part of the value of such easements. The Preservation Trust Fund (PTF) is capitalized through a
25-percent appropriation of the state General Fund allocation for the Virginia Land Conservation Foundation. In Fiscal
"Year 2008, the PTF received $1.1 million."
Easements receiving PTF allocations are conveyed to the Virginia Outdoors Foundation and a local easement co-
"holder. Landowners of property with scenic, scientific, natural, historic, recreational, or open-space value may qualify for"
PTF allocations. Each prospective conservation easement is evaluated by VOF staff and its Board of Trustees using the
"VOF guidelines for accepting easements. Expenditures that may be reimbursed by PTF monies include legal expenses,"
"appraisal costs, and other costs incurred related to the easement donation, as well as the purchase price of all or part of"
the value of the easement.
The vast majority of Preservation Trust Fund awards have been for payment of costs associated with the donation of
"an easement on a family farm by owners of modest financial means. For most PTF applicants, the costs associated with"
"the grant of an easement create an impediment to such easement donation, and the PTF awards can make it feasible"
"for such landowners to proceed with their gifts of easements to the Commonwealth. In Fiscal Year 2008, these awards"
"fostered the protection of more than 9,400 acres of land."
