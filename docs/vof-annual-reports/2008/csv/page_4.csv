Virginia Outdoors Foundation | Fiscal Year 2008 Annual Report
R egional H ighlights
The Virginia Outdoors Foundations serves the Commonwealth through seven regional offices (see map on page 11).
Appalachian Highlands Region
"Our Abingdon office, which opened in 2006, has worked closely with The Land Trust for Southwest Virginia to"
initiate an outreach program to inform landowners and local leaders within the Appalachian Highlands region about
"conservation easements. During FY 2008, more and more landowners began to contact VOF and place easements on"
"their properties. Interest in easements has continued to increase, with neighbors and relatives of easement donors calling"
the Abingdon office to begin the easement process for their own properties. As the number of easement donors increase
"in the Appalachian Highlands region, there will be more positive testimonials, resulting in a robust easement program in"
the most pristine and unspoiled part of Virginia.
Central Region
"Our Central regional office saw new easements in 12 different counties, with a large proportion of working family"
farms and farms of historic significance. Two designated Virginia Century Farms (working farms in the same family
"for over 100 years) were put under easement. In Amherst County, a large farm that is newly under easement contains"
"the historic Galt’s Mill and fronts the James River, affording wonderful sweeping views to those who pass by in car or"
"canoe. Orange County saw a dozen active farm properties join the easement program, including Rockwood, a designated"
"Historic Register property adjoining historic Montpelier, home of President James Madison. Finally, landowners in"
"the region’s southern counties increased their participation in the easement program, with an historic dairy farm near"
"Keysville and five other properties totaling 1,245 acres in Halifax."
Southeast Region
Many of the easements recorded in the Southeast region in FY 2008 were clustered in the farmlands of western
Hanover County and the working timberlands of southern Virginia. Several farms owned by different generations of one
"family were placed into easement, along with several other neighboring farms in the Beaverdam area. Important historic"
"houses were preserved with their settings, including Springfield, which is listed on the National Register of Historic"
Places and the Virginia Historic Landmarks Register. Three of the farms are contiguous and have frontage along the
"Little River and the Newfound River. This grouping now protects more than 1,300 acres of cropland, pastureland, and"
timberland in a rapidly developing county. Protecting contiguous land is an important conservation strategy that helps
"maintain soils and natural processes, provides wildlife corridors, and allows for more efficient use of farmland. With some"
"of the largest intact properties left in the state and a strong timber industry, this region will benefit greatly from VOF’s"
work in the coming years.
Tidewater Region
"The Tidewater regional office worked on a wide variety of easement projects in FY 2008, most notably preserving"
"important riparian areas and historic properties. In upper Essex County, approximately 1,200 acres of prime forest and"
farmland were protected in an area that already contains a large amount of easements and other conserved lands. Several
"miles of tidal shoreline and associated wetlands were protected on the Rappahannock and Potomac rivers, as well as"
"important swamp areas on Dragon Run, which will enhance water quality preservation and improvement efforts in the"
Chesapeake Bay. Several multi-generational family farms were protected on the Northern Neck and Middle Peninsula. In
"addition, VOF worked with the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation and the Virginia Department of Historic Resources"
"to permanently preserve Carter’s Grove, a 400-acre plantation with over one mile of shoreline on the James River just"
below Williamsburg.
