Virginia Outdoors Foundation | Annual Report FY 2009,
"Dear Friends of VOF,",
It took the Virginia Outdoors Foundation 40 years to,
"preserve our first 250,000 acres—a milestone we achieved",
"in 2004. In the next four years, we doubled our portfolio of",
"conservation lands. Today, VOF protects more than half a million",
acres of Virginia’s open spaces. That’s an area two-and-a-half times,
the size of Shenandoah National Park. This achievement makes us,
"the preeminent land trust in the Commonwealth by far, and one",
of the most significant in the nation.,
Virginia’s generous tax incentives for voluntary easements,
have driven this growth. Despite the recent downturn in the,
"economy, we have not seen any indication that the demand to",
preserve open space will wane anytime soon. This presents an,
"opportunity to preserve even more land for future generations,",
but it also presents a challenge for VOF to meet the demand,
during a time when the state’s budget is being cut to the bone.,
"Like all agencies and businesses, VOF must work smarter",
"and more efficiently. In 2009, we began a strategic planning",
"process to help us achieve these goals. It is clear that VOF, as",
"presently structured and funded, cannot continue to sustain the",
same dramatic growth of the last few years. We are looking for,
a responsible and sustainable way forward. We have engaged all,
of our partners in this process—from state agencies and local,VOF easement in Surry County
governments to private land trusts and conservation groups—to,
create what we believe will be a roadmap for Virginia’s land conservation efforts in the coming years.,
