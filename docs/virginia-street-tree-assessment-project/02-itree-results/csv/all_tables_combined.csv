,Virginia’s Street Trees:
August 15th 2012,Findings from a 4-year i-Tree Study
TAKE - HOME MESSAGES
• Inventory and assessment reveals
"assets, liabilities, and opportunities"
for improving street tree function and
value
• Virginia’s communities generally have
well-structured street tree populations
• Vulnerability to EAB is low in Virginia’s
"street trees, but other potential"
vulnerabilities exist
"• Plant diverse, large-stature trees"
whenever possible
