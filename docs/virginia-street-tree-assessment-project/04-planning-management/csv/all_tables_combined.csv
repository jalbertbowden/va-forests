TAKE - HOME MESSAGES
• The urban forestry paradigm
conceptualizes the interelationships of
"structure, function, value, & management"
• Street tree management is cyclical and
is based on resource assessment
• Optimizing structure of street tree
"populations helps ensure resiliency,"
"stability, and functionality"
• High-value street trees are those that
provide maximum benefit at minimal cost
