WORKSHOP CONTEXT
Where are we right now?
Increasing urban tree
cover from 20 to 40%
led to:
"“Overall, 8-hour average"
ozone concentration in urban
areas dropped by 0.5 ppb
(1%) throughout the day.”
"“However, nighttime ozone"
concentrations increased due
to reduced wind speeds and
loss of NOx scavenging of
ozone from increased
deposition of NOx.”
