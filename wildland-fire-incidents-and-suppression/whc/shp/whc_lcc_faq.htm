<dd>

Woodland Home Communities (hereafter WHC) as defined by DOF are clusters of homes located along forested areas at the wildland-urban interface that could possibly be damaged during a nearby wildfire incident.
<P>
Methods: Members of the DOF Wildfire Mitigation Team used GIS to visually review USGS Digital Orthophoto Quarter Quadrangles (DOQQs - Digital Aerial Photography), DOF's Forest Landuse Cover (<A HREF="http://www.vdof.org/gis">&lt;http://www.vdof.org/gis&gt;</A>), US Census Bureau TIGER road data and, when available, building footprints provided by county level government entities to identify areas containing concentrated residential structures that could be at risk of damage during a wildfire incident - a Woodland Home Community.  To qualify as a WHC, these clusters of homes must have: 1) been located close enough to wildland fuels (primarily forested areas) to be potentially damaged by a wildfire; 2) contained greater than 10 addressable structures (auxiliary structures such as sheds, separated garages or carports, barns and stables were not counted when discernable); 3) been geographically isolatable - the community of homes must have formed a cohesive clusters - homes sparsely distributed along a through highway were not considered a WHC.

More detailed hazard ratings will be determined when these WHCs are physically inspected on the ground - WHC Hazard Assessments.<p>

<blockquote>
DOF generated this GIS data layer to: 1) identify areas containing concentrated residential structures that could be at risk of damage during a wildfire incident; 2) to examine the spatial relationships between these communities and DOF's Wildfire Risk Assessment and fire suppression resources such as personnel, fire trucks and hydrants; 3) to better spatially allocate these suppression resources; 4) to target communities for wildfire prevention and education programs.
