<abstract>
Dry hydrant are a non-pressurized pipe systems permanently installed along existing lakes, ponds and streams that provides a suction supply of water to a fire department tank truck.  In rural areas, a lack of water mains and pressurized fire hydrants can sometimes impair a fire department&apos;s ability to do its job quickly and efficiently. The success of a fire department&apos;s operation hinges on the distance a truck must travel to fill-up and return to the fire. In many cases these fill-up points are often long distances from the fire and the firefighters are unable to maintain an uninterrupted water source at the scene.  The availability of a dry hydrant can drastically reduce the challenge of suppressing structure fires and wildfires occurring in rural areas.  

NOTE: Some of the hydrants included in this dataset were not functional (see HydCond field) on the date they were inspected (see DateOnSite field).  Additionally, some of the waterbodies from which the hydrants draw water did not contain enough water for the hydrant to be usable (see WATERBODY field).

NOTE: This dataset is currently INCOMPLETE.  Hydrants that failed quality assurance/quality control tests have been sent back to the local forestrer for correction.

NOTE: This dataset does not contain pressurized hydrants (&quot;traditional&quot; hydrants attached to pressurized water main systems).  Those seeking pressurized hydrant data should contact the local/city/county GIS department(s) presiding over their area of interest.

VDOF relies on geographic data regarding the location of pressurized hydrants in assessing which areas of the state are in need of dry hydrants.  If you work for an organization or government agency that maintain data on pressurized hydrants, please send the current data to alex.zendel@dof.virginia.gov or mindia.brown@dof.virginia.gov
</abstract>
<purpose>To provide dry hydrant locations to Virginia organizations operating at the local, county and state levels.  This dataset may be useful in assessing an area&apos;s current emergency response system and in planning the location for future dry hydrant installations</purpose>

<complete>INCOMPLETE.  VDOF has not yet received GPS locations of dry hydrants in Hanover County from a local contractor.  Additionally, hydrants that did not pass the quality control/assurance test will be returned to local VDOF staff for verification/correction</complete>
<posacc>
<horizpa>
<horizpar>Roughly half of these dry hydrant points (n = 587) were overlaid on 1m resolution aerial photography from the Virginia Base Mapping Program (VBMP - http://www.vgin.vipnet.org/VBMP/VBMPHandbook_r2.pdf) and visually inspected.  If a hydrant point was located along a visible water feature and along a visible access road, then its location was deemed accurate.   Hydrants that did not appear to be accurately located were returned to local VDOF for verification/correction. The hydrants that were not visibly inspected were those designated as &quot;Pond/Lake&quot; and less than 60 meters from the nearest water body feature in a hydrography GIS layer primarily composed of data from VBMP and supplemented with data from the National Hydrography Dataset (http://nhd.usgs.gov/).  These hydrants (n = 681) were presumed to be accurately located.</horizpar>

<procdesc>VDOF staff working at the county level visited all hydrants in this database, with the exceptions of the hydrants where Source = &apos;Dynamic Industries&apos;, and completed paper data collection forms.  These data were entered into a Microsoft Access database.  This database was imported into ArcGIS and the point features were generated from the latitude and longitude coordinates.  The resulting feature points were then verified for accuracy (see &quot;How accurate are the geographic locations?&quot; below).  This dataset was then forward projected into its current coordinate system (see &quot;What coordinate system is used to represent geographic features?&quot;).</procdesc>

</edom>
<edom>
<edomv>Adequate</edomv>
<edomvd>The hydrant&apos;s intake pipe was not exposed, but the water level of the water body was far from full (a full pool in a pond/lake or high water in stream).</edomvd>

<attrdomv>
<edom>
<edomv>Poor</edomv>
<edomvd>The hydrant was not directly accessible; no emergency vehicle could drive right up to it. This condition could have been due to a washed out road, downed timber or other debris blocking the road or the complete lack of a road.
