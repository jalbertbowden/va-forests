<A NAME="why"><h3>Why was the data set created?</h3></A>
<blockquote>
Data are collected routinely to track occurrence of wildfire in Virginia.  This dataset is used in various ways, including: 1) as an input layer in DOF's Wildfire Risk Assessment Model; 2) to identify areas of the state where fire incidents are more prevalent; 3) To examine wildfire occurrence with other geographic and tabular datasets in order to better understand the factors that contribute to wildfire incidents.

<ol>
<li><A NAME="quality.1"><b>How well have the observations been checked?</b></A><p>
The attributes in this dataset are of moderate quality.  Due to data entry error or omission, many records have empty or incorrect fields.  Some effort was made to retrieve information from the original hardcopy report; however, most of the QA/QC was focused on correction of location.
<p>
<li><A NAME="quality.2"><b>How accurate are the geographic locations?</b></A><p>
Most feature locations were generated from latitude/longitude coordinates as reported on Virginia Dept. of Forestry Wildfire Incident Reports.  Most coordinates were obtained from Virginia Dept. of Transportation county maps (varying scale) with 1 minute grids/graticules or Delorme's Virginia Gazetteer (1:150,000).  Most of the coordinates were reported in a dd mm.m' format, but several localities truncated the minutes figures to integers (zero significant figures).   If the coordinate fields on the physical fire report were missing or easily identified as erroneous, the location of the fire was estimated from the written location description if that information was sufficient.  This manual process was conducted using MapTech's Terrain Navigator (2001), Microsoft's TerraServer (<A HREF="http://terraserver.homeadvisor.msn.com/">&lt;http://terraserver.homeadvisor.msn.com/&gt;</A>), TopoZone.com, ESRI's ArcExplorer or ArcGIS.
<P>
Upon data entry completion, positional quality control tests were run on the fire incident points and when errors were detected, the corresponding records were flagged.  Three attribute fields representing these QC tests are included in this final fire incident database.  A value of 1 indicates that the fire failed that particular test.  First, the county in which the fire incident point occurred was compared to the county specified on the fire incident report (field = &quot;CNTY_TEST&quot;).  Secondly, fires points that plotted in water bodies were also flagged (field = &quot;WATER_TEST&quot;)*.  Lastly, the distance between railroad tracks** and fires reported to have been caused by a railroad was calculated.  Those that were greater than 375 meters from a railroad were flagged (field = &quot;RR_TEST&quot;).   A summary by county of these flagged records was then tabulated.  Due to the large number of fires that failed the county test but were within close range of the intended county, those that were within 0.2 mile from the intended county were removed from the failing set (such fires are coded as &quot;yes&quot; in the &quot;ALLOWABL&quot; field.)  If the percentage of detectably erroneous fires points in a particular county was less than  than 10% error, these points were removed from this dataset.  If the error pencentage was greater than 10% then the physical fire incident reports for the failing fires were obtained and an attempt was made to manually move these points to a more accurate location if the written &quot;location&quot; text on the report was adequate for doing so.  For example, if a Fire Incident Report noted the location of the fire as &quot;On the north side of the James River approximately &frac14; mile west of the US29 bridge&quot;, its location could be reasonably estimated.   On the contrary, if a fire's location was reported as &quot;at the end of county route 624&quot; and that route has two outlets, then its location could not be estimated and it remained as a part of the failing set.  After this &quot;correction&quot; process, a summary on the errors by county was again run to verify that no county exceeded 10% error.  All remaining erroneous fires/records (n=413 of 9900, 4.17%) were then deleted.  The resulting, &quot;final&quot; database contains 9487 features/records.
*The USGS/EPA National Hydrography Dataset waterbody data, excluding polygons where TYPE = 'Swamp/Marsh', was used in this QC test

Practically every DOF Wildfire Incident Report for the years 1995 to 2001 inclusive was reviewed and entered into the database used to generate this layer.  Some &quot;mutual aid&quot; fires, fires that were primarily managed by other agencies to which DOF provided assistance, were not documented on a DOF Wildfire Incident Report and are thus not included in this dataset.
