New River Trail State Park and the Virginia Creeper Trail Club. They have been excellent
"partners, opening their organizations to the students and taking the time to engage in a"
"sincere and open discussion about ideas. I would especially like to thank Link Elmore, Sam"
"Sweeney and Chuck Wyatt, representatives of our client organizations, for working with us"
to scope out the nature of the project you see here. Our thanks also goes to many
"government and community leaders in Damascus and Galax, government representatives"
"of Washington County, as well as industry leaders elsewhere including those from the"
"Virginia Tourism Corporation, Roanoke Regional Partnership, Pulaski County, the Town of"
"Pulaski, all of who provided insights and guidance to the students over the course of this"
