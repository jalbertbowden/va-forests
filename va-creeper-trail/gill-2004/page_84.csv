variables did not show evidence of collinearity.,The highest correlation was between INCOME,The highest correlation was between INCOME
and HIGHUSE (r = -.322) in the zero opportunity cost model and between income and travel,and HIGHUSE (r = -.322) in the zero opportunity cost model and between income and travel,and HIGHUSE (r = -.322) in the zero opportunity cost model and between income and travel
cost (r = .334) in the 1⁄4 the wage rate model.,The other difference seen in the two models was,The other difference seen in the two models was
the coefficient sign for the number of individuals in the household (NUM) who use the VCT.,the coefficient sign for the number of individuals in the household (NUM) who use the VCT.,the coefficient sign for the number of individuals in the household (NUM) who use the VCT.
