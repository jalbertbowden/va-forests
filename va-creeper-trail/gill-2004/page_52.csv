,This thesis uses two variations on time costs.,The first values the opportunity cost of
time at 1/4 the wage rate. Cesario (1976) reported that nonworking travel time should be valued,time at 1/4 the wage rate. Cesario (1976) reported that nonworking travel time should be valued,time at 1/4 the wage rate. Cesario (1976) reported that nonworking travel time should be valued
