<dt><em>Abstract:</em>  
<dd>

This dataset includes polygons of hardwood tree defoliation caused by larvae of the fall cankerworm, a native inchworm.  Limited to extensive outbreaks of this insect occur somewhere in Virginia every few years and last from one to several years.  They are more common in the mountains, but occur in piedmont and coastal plain areas as well.  Polygons are delimited mostly by aerial sketchmapping, but ground surveys are also used.  Data for this layer were collected 5/31/02.

</dd>
<dt><em>Supplemental_Information:</em>  
<dd>

All defoliation mapped during this survey was moderate to heavy.

Aerial survey of fall cankerworm defoliation in 2002 was limited to the Blue Ridge counties from Greene to Fauquier.  Other mapped polygons were detected from ground surveys.  Time and other resource limitations prevented surveys of some southwestern mountain areas where periodic fall cankerworm defoliation is common.  Heavy defoliation in populated areas rarely goes unreported and it is unlikely that such occurrences were overlooked.  For example, a small patch of defoliation by cankerworms in the City of Danville was reported, but not mapped.
