a. Urban land is based on population density and was delimited using the United States Census definitions of urbanized areas and urban clusters.,,,,,
b. Community land is based on jurisdictional or political boundaries of communities based on United States Census definitions of incorporated or census designated places.,,,,,
"c. Urban or communities is land that is urban, community, or both. Communities may include all, some, or no urban land within their boundaries.",,,,,
d. Canopy green space is the tree canopy cover divided by total green space.,,,,,
e. Total green space (TGS) is total area - impervious surface cover - water.,,,,,
